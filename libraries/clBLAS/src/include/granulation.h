 * computing item gets as what chunk it evaluates at a time.
 * The chunk processed at a time is typically bound by amount
 * of resources consumed at this level of decomposition while
 * the whole portion is bound of amount of more high level resources
 * to be available, and can also be used for the purpose of work
 * balancing.
