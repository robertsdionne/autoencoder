The
problem
is
that
customers
attracted
by
a
simple
interface
are
among
the
least
loyal
you
can
find
--
witness
the
fight
-
for
-
fewest
-
features
between
low
-
end
camera
companies
.

The
other
problem
?

It
's
tough
to
make
money
branching
out
when
your
appeal
is
in
your
focus
.

As
the
survey
cited
in
the
above
-
linked
article
shows
,
most
Google
users
do
n't
intend
to
use
Gmail
,
and
Google
is
n't
even
as
popular
as
Yahoo!
and
AOL
.

If
they
continue
to
add
features
so
they
can
justify
their
likely
sky
-
high
valuation
,
Google
risks
losing
a
huge
chunk
of
their
customer
base
to
the
next
keep
-
it
-
simple
search
engine
.

Google
has
finally
had
an
analyst
day
--
a
chance
to
present
the
company
's
story
to
the
(
miniscule
number
of
)
people
who
have
n't
heard
it
.

Usually
,
these
are
just
a
chance
for
the
suckups
to
suck
up
,
but
this
time
people
are
actually
concerned
about
the
company
's
plans
.

They
work
on
Wall
Street
,
after
all
,
so
when
they
hear
a
company
who's
stated
goals
include
"
Do
n't
be
evil
,
"
they
imagine
a
company
who's
eventually
history
will
be
"
Do
n't
be
profitable
.
"

It
's
not
quite
as
freewheeling
an
environment
as
you
'd
imagine
:
Sergey
Brin
has
actually
created
a
mathematical
'
proof
'
that
the
company
's
self
-
driven
research
strategy
,
which
gives
employees
one
day
a
week
to
do
research
projects
on
their
own
,
is
a
good
,
respectable
idea
.

Read
the
entire
article
;
there
's
a
punchline
,
too
.

Let
me
join
the
chorus
of
annoyance
over
Google
's
new
toolbar
,
which
,
as
noted
in
the
linked
article
,
commits
just
about
every
sin
an
online
marketer
could
commit
,
and
makes
up
a
few
new
ones
besides
.

I
'm
not
fond
of
the
Google
-
hates
-
privacy
argument

(
You
do
n't
need
to
use
their
site
,
you
can
opt
-
out
of
sharing
your
information
,
you
do
n't
need
to
send
stuff
to
anyone
with
a
Gmail
account
,
and
if
--
wonder
of
wonders
--
you
're
worried
that
you
might
send
something
to
someone
who
would
forward
an
excerpt
to
someone
who
would
then
store
it
on
a
Gmail
account
...
you
have
far
,
far
too
much
time
on
your
hands
)
.

However
,
this
toolbar
is
really
bad
news
.

On
the
other
hand
,
it
looks
pretty
cool
.

(
And
,
by
the
way
,
is
anybody
else
just
a
little
nostalgic
for
the
days
when
that
was
a
good
thing
?
)

This
BuzzMachine
post
argues
that
Google
's
rush
toward
ubiquity
might
backfire
--
which
we
've
all
heard
before
,
but
it
's
particularly
well
-
put
in
this
post
.

Google
is
a
nice
search
engine
.

Does
anybody
use
it
for
anything
else
?

They
own
blogger
,
of
course
.

Is
that
a
money
maker
?

I
'm
staying
away
from
the
stock
.

Warren
Buffett
is
giving
away
85
%
of
his
wealth
,
mostly
to
the
Bill
and
Melinda
Gates
Foundation
.

It
's
a
move
that
really
worries
me
;
Buffett
's
usual
justification
for
keeping
most
of
his
money
was
that
he
was
still
compounding
the
value
of
his
fortune
at
a
pretty
high
rate
,
so
any
gifts
now
would
mean
significantly
less
money
for
the
foundation
later
.

It
's
a
little
hard
to
parse
,
but
at
this
point
his
ostensible
view
is
that
the
Gateses
are
very
good
money
-
redistributors
,
and
he
wants
them
to
have
the
money
as
soon
as
possible
.

Which
essentially
sounds
like
he
's
worried
that
Bill
or
Melinda
are
going
to
die
soon
.

I
assume
his
actual
reason
is
that
he
's
worried
that
Berkshire
Hathaway
just
ca
n't
grow
quickly
enough
to
justify
his
usual
charity
policy
.

I
'm
not
sure
how
the
market
will
react
.

It
does
n't
change
the
company
's
intrinsic
worth
,
and
as
the
article
notes
,
the
company
might
be
added
to
a
major
index
once
the
shares
get
more
liquid
.

On
the
other
hand
,
this
is
essentially
a
statement
that
the
company
is
overpriced
from
the
guy
who
knows
it
best
--
and
happens
to
be
the
best
investor
of
the
last
century
.

em
...
no
...
the
Gates
foundation
mainly
invests
in
medical
research
and
education
,
that
means
donating
now
adds
a
tremendous
value
compared
to
donating
in
ten
years
.

Because
the
10.000.000
people
dying
from
malaria
will
otherwise
be
dead
.

i.e
.

He
's
not
giving
85
%
away
,
he
's
giving
a
number
of
shares
each
year
that
decrease
in
number
at
the
rate
of
5
%
a
year
(
until
gone
?
)
.

He
mentions
his
wife
's
death
having
an
effect
on
him
.

It
sounds
pretty
rational
that
he
's
saying
that
Bill
and
Melinda
are
at
a
prime
spot
,
so
starting
the
money
hose
now
is
a
good
idea
,
but
Buffet
is
still
keeping
most
of
his
donation
inside
of
Berkshire
where
it
will
compound
.

From
the
AP
comes
this
story
:

President
Bush
on
Tuesday
nominated
two
individuals
to
replace
retiring
jurists
on
federal
courts
in
the
Washington
area
.

Bush
nominated
Jennifer
M.
Anderson
for
a
15
-
year
term
as
associate
judge
of
the
Superior
Court
of
the
District
of
Columbia
,
replacing
Steffen
W.
Graae
.

***

Bush
also
nominated
A.
Noel
Anketell
Kramer
for
a
15
-
year
term
as
associate
judge
of
the
District
of
Columbia
Court
of
Appeals
,
replacing
John
Montague
Steadman
.

Remember
Luis
Posada
Carriles
?

Here
's
a
Miami
Herald
interview
with
the
relaxed
terrorist
and
former
CIA
operative
in
a
luxury
condo
,
published
yesterday
.

(
"
At
first
I
hid
a
lot
.

I
thought
the
US
government
was
looking
for
me
.

Now
I
hide
a
lot
less
.
"
)

Because
of
such
talk
,
Posada
has
been
taken
into
custody
by
Immigration
officials
.

I
ca
n't
imagine
they
wanted
to
do
this
.

Authorities
would
likely
have
been
happy
answering
questions
about
Posada
's
whereabouts
with
an
indefinite
shrug
.

As
recently
as
last
week
the
official
line
stated
they
had
no
knowledge
he
had
entered
the
country
.

But
comfortable
among
the
thugs
,
Posada
overplayed
his
hand
and
embarrassed
his
old
patron
,
the
US
government
.

And
though
he
'd
been
a
faithful
servant
,
he
was
not
such
a
player
that
he
could
get
away
with
that
.

He
should
have
taken
a
cue
from
another
bomber
some
pesky
dark
-
skinned
foreigners
want
extradited
,
CIA
operative
Michael
Meiring
.

Posada
should
have
told
any
inquisitive
journalist
at
his
doorstep
something
like
Meiring
told
the
single
American
reporter
who
bothered
following
his
bloody
trail
from
the
Philippines
,
that
"
If
this
harms
me
in
any
way
,
you
will
find
my
power
then
,
and
you
'll
find
out
who
I
am
.
"

But
then
,
maybe
that
would
n't
have
saved
him
either
,
because
Posada
is
not
Meiring
.

Posada
can
be
given
up
,
but
Meiring
ca
n't
.

Meiring
's
crimes
are
fresh
,
and
wave
the
false
flag
which
is
the
"
War
on
Terror
.
"

They
happened
in
the
Philippines
which
,
like
Pakistan
,
is
an
important
and
vulnerable
node
for
the
business
which
intelligence
agencies
and
terrorist
organizations
conduct
with
each
other
.

(
Ask
Terry
Nichols
about
the
Philippines
.
)

The
bombings
implicated
Muslims
,
and
exacerbated
regional
tensions
which
the
Bush
regime
and
its
friends
wearing
the
brass
in
the
Philippine
military
sought
to
exploit
.

Posada
's
crimes
,
on
the
other
hand
,
must
seem
like
ancient
history
,
especially
to
a
people
who
do
n't
know
their
history
.

And
to
those
who
do
n't
even
know
their
crimes
,
not
even
that
.

But
will
Posada
be
given
up
?

I
doubt
he
will
be
extradited
to
Venezuela
,
which
is
the
only
way
that
question
could
be
answered
with
a
Yes
.

I
expect
it
will
be
determined
that
,
under
"
Strong
Man
"
Hugo
Chavez
,
Posada
could
not
be
guaranteed
a
fair
trial
.

The
hope
may
be
that
Posada
can
soon
be
offered
to
a
post-Chavez
Allawi
-
like
puppet
in
Caracas
.

Whether
such
an
offer
were
accepted
or
declined
would
make
no
difference
;
justice
would
not
be
served
then
.

But
Posada
's
nearly
80
years
old
,
and
the
Venezuelan
people
will
ensure
that
's
a
vain
hope
.

So
instead
Posada
may
be
held
indefinitely
,
in
comfortable
custody
.

An
embarrassment
to
the
US
still
,
just
not
as
embarrassing
as
having
the
old
killer
strut
about
Miami
,
gloating
in
his
freedom
.

Meiring
is
more
than
an
embarrassment
.

His
case
threatens
the
consensus
fiction
of
the
"
War
on
Terror
.
"

So
his
name
will
remain
unspoken
.

Another
connection
to
Philippine
terror
and
weapons
smuggling
-
dating
from
the
1980s
-
is
alleged
in
the
book
Disposable
Patriot
,
by
Jack
Terrell
.

Terrell
,
a
CIA
asset
originally
recruited
for
the
Contra
effort
,
identifies
the
man
attempting
to
recruit
him
into
the
Philippine
scheme
as
Oliver
North
...

I
seem
to
recall
the
object
was
to
smuggle
explosives
.

http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0915765381/701-3377456-8181939

I
've
read
the
book
-
it
's
a
first
person
memoir
with
the
ring
of
truth
,
especially
since
so
much
of
the
wider
context
has
confirmed
the
allegations
of
Contra
drug
connections
that
led
to
Terrell
becoming
a
target
for
discrediting
by
the
TWIG
counterintelligence
group
that
ran
interference
for
the
Contra
effort
,
staffed
by
covert
ops
types
including
Ollie
North
,
Robert
Owen
,
Vince
Cannistaro
and
Buck
Revell
.

Peter
Dale
Scott
includes
an
account
of
how
Terrell
's
whistleblowing
was
stifled
by
them
in
his
book
Cocaine
Politics
.

Due
to
the
Judge
in
the
1983
case
ruling
that
a
CIA
agent
could
not
testify
using
a
pseudonym
,
therefore
opening
him
to
cross-examination
by
Wilson
,
the
prosecution
had
a
problem
.

They
needed
someone
that
could
convince
the
jury
they
had
been
able
to
see
all
relevant
documents
in
CIA
files
on
Wilson
.

Wilson
was
claiming
that
he
had
been
working
for
the
CIA
when
he
sold
the
C
-
4
to
Quaddaffi
.

The
prosecution
was
charging
he
was
a
rogue
using
his
contacts
from
former
service
in
both
CIA
and
the
'
Office
of
Naval
Intelligence
'
.

Wilson
had
been
able
to
show
that
he
'd
had
more
than
80
"
non-social
contacts
"
with
the
CIA
since
his
retirement
in
1971
,
leaving
the
prosecution
's
case
in
turmoil
.

Then
Charles
A.
Briggs
came
to
the
rescue
.

Third
ranking
CIA
officer
,
Briggs
signed
a
declaration
on
February
3rd
,
1983
,
that
on
November
8th
,
1982
,
he
had
authorized
a
search
of
CIA
records
"
for
any
material
that
in
any
way
pertains
to
Edwin
P.
Wilson
,
or
the
various
allegations
concerning
his
activities
after
February
28th
,
1971
,
when
he
retired
from
the
CIA
.
"

The
Briggs
Declaration
states
that
with
one
exception
in
1972
,
Wilson
did
not
work
"
directly
or
indirectly
"
for
the
CIA
since
retiring
.

Last
week
,
Federal
District
Judge
Lynn
Hughes
in
Huston
,
Texas
,
threw
out
Wilson
's
two
-
decades
old
conviction
.

Judge
Hughes
wrote
:
`
government
knowingly
used
false
evidence
against
him

'
concluding
`
honesty
comes
hard
to
government

Former

,
Deputy
Implicated
In
Church
Child
Sex
Abuse

PONCHATOULA
,
La.
--

Sheriff
's
deputies
in
Louisiana
made
a
third
arrest
Wednesday
in
the
ongoing
investigation
of
a
case
involving
allegations
of
sexual
abuse
of
children
and
animals
at
a
Ponchatoula
,
La.
,
church
.

Austin
Aaron
Bernard
III
,
36
,
was
arrested
on
a
charge
of
aggravated
rape
of
a
child
under
the
age
of
13
.

Police
said
Bernard
confessed
to
detectives
that
he
had
sex
with
a
young
girl
in
November
2002
and
admitted
to
knowing
about
sexual
acts
involving
children
and
a
dog
that
occurred
at
Hosanna
Church
.

Tangipahoa
Parish
sheriff
's
deputy
Christopher
Blair
Labat
,
24
,
was
booked
Tuesday
on
one
count
of
aggravated
rape
and
one
count
of
crime
against
nature
.

On
Monday
,
Louis
Lamonica
,
45
,
the
former
pastor
of
Hosanna
Church
,
was
booked
with
two
counts
of
aggravated
rape
and
one
count
of
crime
against
nature
after
he
walked
in
to
the
Livingston
Parish
Sheriff
's
Office
and
said
he
could
implicate
others
in
a
situation
at
the
church
that
reportedly
occurred
two
years
ago
.

We
have
a
similar
case
unravelling
up
here
in
the
northwest
with
a
murder
of
a
family
and
missing
children
taken
for
some
purpose
.

If
I
was
Rummy
I
'd
send
Posada
to
Iraq
to
blow
things
up
there

Afraid
I
do
n't
have
time
today
to
discuss
these
,
but
some
stories
need
attention
:

From
Wednesday
's
Mirror
the
headline
,
"
Have
200,000
AK47s
Fallen
Into
the
Hands
of
Iraq
Terrorists
?
"

(
also
see
this
thread
on
the
RI
discussion
board
)
:

Some
200,000
guns
the
US
sent
to
Iraqi
security
forces
may
have
been
smuggled
to
terrorists
,
it
was
feared
yesterday
.

The
99
-
tonne
cache
of
AK47s
was
to
have
been
secretly
flown
out
from
a
US
base
in
Bosnia
.

But
the
four
planeloads
of
arms
have
vanished
.

Orders
for
the
deal
to
go
ahead
were
given
by
the
US
Department
of
Defense
.

But
the
work
was
contracted
out
via
a
complex
web
of
private
arms
traders
.

And
the
Moldovan
airline
used
to
transport
the
shipment
was
blasted
by
the
UN
in
2003
for
smuggling
arms
to
Liberia
,
human
rights
group
Amnesty
has
discovered
.

It
follows
a
separate
probe
claiming
that
thousands
of
guns
meant
for
Iraq
's
police
and
army
instead
went
to
al
-
Qaeda
.

Amnesty
chief
spokesman
Mike
Blakemore
said
:
"
It
's
unbelievable
that
no
one
can
account
for
200,000
assault
rifles
.

If
these
weapons
have
gone
missing
it
's
a
terrifying
prospect
.
"

American
defence
chiefs
hired
a
US
firm
to
take
the
guns
,
from
the
90s
Bosnian
war
,
to
Iraq
.

But
air
traffic
controllers
in
Baghdad
have
no
record
of
the
flights
,
which
supposedly
took
off
between
July
2004
and
July
2005
.

A
coalition
forces
spokesman
confirmed
they
had
not
received
"
any
weapons
from
Bosnia
"
and
added
they
were
"
not
aware
of
any
purchases
for
Iraq
from
Bosnia
"
.

Nato
and
US
officials
have
already
voiced
fears
that
Bosnian
arms
-
sold
by
US
,
British
and
Swiss
firms
-
are
being
passed
to
insurgents
.

A
NATO
spokesman
said
:
"
There
's
no
tracking
mechanism
to
ensure
they
do
n't
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
.

There
are
concerns
that
some
may
have
been
siphoned
off
.
"

This
year
a
newspaper
claimed
two
UK
firms
were
involved
in
a
deal
in
which
thousands
of
guns
for
Iraqi
forces
were
re-routed
to
al
-
Qaeda
.

The
Moldovan
airline
is
Aerocom
,
and
yes
,
it
's
one
of
Victor
Bout
's
.

It
's
always
a
bang
-
your
-
head
-
against
-
the
-
wall
moment
,
reading
again
the
play
the
incompetence
theory
receives
,
even
from
some
of
the
Administration
's
harshest
mainstream
critics
.

But
then
,
even
to
talk
of
an
"
administration
"
may
be
misdirection
at
this
point
,
given
how
little
representative
government
means
in
the
United
States
these
days
,
and
how
much
of
"
national
security
"
has
been
privatized
into
a
global
gangland
of
drugs
and
guns
.

Like
the
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
that
have
been
"
lost
"
in
Iraq
,
planeloads
of
arms
do
n't
just
"
vanish
"
;
not
when
the
Pentagon
contracts
the
work
to
an
international
criminal
of
Bout
's
untouchable
stature
.

But
Bout
's
name
is
n't
likely
to
be
mentioned
in
whatever
coverage
this
story
receives
,
before
it
sinks
like
so
many
others
beneath
the
media
's
frothing
triviality
.

Meanwhile
,
a
decision
's
been
reached
in
the
trial
of
Toledo
priest
Gerald
Robinson
.

And
it
's
guilty
:

The
Rev.
Gerald
Robinson
appeared
stony
-
faced
as
the
jury
's
guilty
verdict
was
read
,
and
he
blinked
repeatedly
and
glanced
at
his
lawyers
before
being
led
away
in
handcuffs
.

...

The
crime
occurred
in
the
sacristy
adjoining
the
hospital
chapel
in
downtown
Toledo
on
the
Saturday
before
Easter
in
1980
.

Investigators
said
the
nun
,
Margaret
Ann
Pahl
,
71
,
was
strangled
and
then
stabbed
,
with
nine
wounds
on
her
chest
forming
the
shape
of
an
inverted
cross
,
a
well
-
recognized
Satanic
symbol
.

An
altar
cloth
was
draped
over
her
half
-
naked
body
,
which
was
posed
as
if
she
had
been
sexually
assaulted
.

"
It
was
about
how
he
could
humiliate
her
the
most
,
"
prosecutor
Dean
Mandros
said
in
closing
arguments
.

"
He
left
a
message
for
everyone
to
see
...
maybe
to
God
himself
.
"

After
the
sentencing
one
of
Robinson
's
tearful
supporters
"
turned
to
Claudia
Vercellotti
,
a
local
leader
of
the
Survivors
Network
for
Those
Abused
by
Priests
[
SNAP
]
,
who
had
helped
reopen
the
case
,
and
told
her
,
'
I
hope
you
rot
in
hell
!
'
"

From
SNAP
's
statement
on
the
Robinson
conviction
:

More
than
ever
,
police
and
prosecutors
have
the
tools
and
the
will
to
go
after
horrific
crimes
,
even
when
the
defendants
are
seemingly
powerful
individuals
or
institutions
.

When
victims
and
witnesses
stay
silent
,
nothing
changes
.

When
victims
and
witnesses
speak
up
,
at
least
sometimes
a
child
is
protected
,
the
truth
is
exposed
,
and
justice
is
done
.

The
murder
weapon
,
Robinson
's
letter
opener
:

Finally
,
from
an
email
,
a
follow
-
up
on
the
reopening
of
the
investigation
into
the
Atlanta
Child
Murders
:

Dekalb
County
Police
Chief
Louis
Graham
...
the
man
who
reopened
the
investigations
last
year
,
is
mysteriously
stepping
down
.

And
of
all
the
people
who
the
county
is
getting
to
find
a
replacement
...
is
none
other
than
Lee
Brown
,
the
original
supervisor
of
the
Atlanta
PD
,
who
was
in
office
during
the
murders
and
the
subsequent
investigation
.

SNAP
is
right
in
part
.

Police
and
prosecutors
have
the
tools
.

The
will
is
another
matter
.

Some
do
,
individually
.

But
institutionally
?

That
's
still
the
domain
of
those
who
do
n't
.

CRACKDOWN
ON
POLYGAMY
GROUP

Small
polygamous
groups
have
existed
in
the
southwestern
US
under
the
watchful
yet
fairly
benign
eye
of
authorities
ever
since
a
sect
known
as
the
Fundamentalist
Latter
Day
Saints
(
FLDS
)
separated
itself
from
mainstream
Mormonism
in
1890
.

...

Now
,
FLDS
leader
Warren
Jeffs
has
been
added
to
the
FBI
's
list
of
"
Ten
Most
Wanted
Fugitives
,
"
a
move
that
caps
law
enforcement
's
dramatic
change
of
approach
toward
the
polygamous
group
in
recent
years
...
[
because
of
]
the
impact
that
the
group
's
practices
,
law
enforcement
officials
say
,
are
having
on
the
most
vulnerable
within
the
sect
,
particularly
children
and
women
.

When
the
FLDS
under
Mr.
Jeffs
(
and
his
father
before
him
)
grew
to
some
10,000
followers
in
several
southwestern
communities
with
estimated
assets
of
$
110
million
;
when
it
became
clear
that
government
officials
,
school
authorities
,
and
police
in
those
communities
had
become
intertwined
with
the
sect
;
when
ex-members
increasingly
reported
child
and
sexual
abuse
charges
(
mainly
involving
underage
girls
forced
to
marry
older
men
)
;
and
when
the
sect
began
to
use
secluded
compounds
,
state
and
federal
authorities
started
to
crack
down
more
vigorously
.

...

Specifically
,
Jeffs
is
charged
in
Utah
and
Arizona
with
sexual
assault
of
underage
girls
and
with
arranging
"
spiritual
"
marriages
for
girls
and
older
men
.

At
weekend
press
conferences
in
Salt
Lake
City
and
Phoenix
,
FBI
and
state
officials
said
Jeffs
"
is
considered
armed
and
dangerous
and
may
be
traveling
with
armed
bodyguards
.
"

In
the
past
,
he
has
talked
in
apocalyptic
terms
about
a
violent
end
to
the
world
,
according
to
former
members
.

...

As
with
Christian
Identity
and
other
hate
-
related
philosophies
tied
to
the
Aryan
Nations
and
the
neo-Nazi
Creativity
Movement
,
Jeffs
has
preached
racism
as
well
.

"
The
black
race
is
the
people
through
which
the
devil
has
always
been
able
to
bring
evil
unto
the
earth
,
"
Jeffs
has
said
as
cited
by
the
Southern
Poverty
Law
Center
's
"
Intelligence
Report
.
"

An
editorial
in
the
church
-
owned
Deseret
Morning
News
in
Salt
Lake
City
earlier
this
year
acknowledged
that
"
the
state
's
history
,
a
conservative
belief
in
free
choice
,
and
an
unwillingness
to
stir
up
a
hornet
's
nest
in
the
national
media
have
likely
all
contributed
to
the
kid
-
glove
approach
lawmakers
and
law
-
enforcement
officers
have
taken
when
dealing
with
polygamous
communities
.

The
Raw
Story

i
count
like
14
explosive
headlines
.

Then
,
of
course
,
there
is
the
evidence
the
jury
did
not
hear
about
in
the
Robinson
case
...

Funny
how
some
things
are
squirelled
away
by
well
-
meaning
prosecutors
...

Maybe
because
they
hint
at
a
larger
conspiracy
/
network
of
abusers
/
satanic
underground
?

I
read
of
a
case
not
long
ago
when
some
people
were
trying
to
get
a
polygamous
judge
taken
off
the
bench
for
not
obeying
state
law
.

Of
course
law
enforcement
has
dragged
it's
feet
when
members
are
taking
part
in
the
activity
themselves
.

Personally
I
do
n't
give
a
damn
what
adults
do
to
one
another
as
long
as
there
is
no
abuse
invovled
.

It
is
the
marrying
off
of
young
girls
to
older
men
often
close
relatives
that
enfurates
me
.

Also
these
cults
have
multimillions
yet
the
women
and
kids
live
in
poverty
so
the
leaders
can
live
the
high
life
.

In
the
Warren
Jeffs
cult
he
reassigns
wives
if
the
husband
displeases
him
or
to
reward
the
new
husband
.

Husbands
marry
mothers
and
teen
daughters
at
the
same
time
.

a
rare
form
of
retardation
is
showing
up
in
that
group
more
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
.

It
is
genetic
and
the
child
needs
to
get
the
gene
from
both
parents
to
turn
into
a
vegetable
instead
of
a
thinking
child
.

The
doctor
begs
them
to
stop
intermarrying
but
they
say
they
have
to
keep
the
blood
pure
.

look
up
fumarase
deficiency
for
more
info
.

Also
look
up
the
kingston
family
.

One
member
actually
was
convicted
of
beating
his
teen
daughter
unconcious
when
she
ran
away
from
'
marriage
'
to
her
father
's
own
brother
.

no
one
was
charged
for
forced
marriage
,
only
the
beating
.

So
we
"
lost
"
some
weapon
?

It
's
a
good
thing
too
.

We
would
n't
want
those
terrorists
to
run
out
of
shit
to
shoot
at
us
.

Then
the
war
might
stop
&
all
those
juicy
profits
would
just
evaporate
.

What
's
a
few
dead
soldiers
in
comparison
to
keeping
all
those
defense
contractors
awash
in
all
that
tax
cash
?

They
really
are
milking
the
incompetence
angle
though
,
are
n't
they
?

Just
another
big
Iraq
whoopsie
daisy
,
huh
?

Christ
,
you
'd
think
America
would
get
a
bit
tired
of
these
guys
treating
her
like
she
was
populated
with
nothing
but
gullible
idiots
.

I
suppose
that
it
's
damn
lucky
for
the
GOP
that
she
is
populated
with
gullible
idiots
.

A
country
deserves
the
leaders
it
has
,
my
friends
...

And
MEK
--
the
Iranian
(
not
Iraqi
)
terror
group
in
question
--
is
itself
unquestionably
a
cult
:

As
the
leaders
like
to
boast
,
the
Mujahedeen
is
a
family
affair
.

(
''
We
have
three
generations
of
martyrs
:
grandmothers
,
mothers
,
daughters
.
''
)

Most
of
the
girls
I
was
meeting
had
grown
up
in
Mujahedeen
schools
in
Ashraf
,
where
they
lived
separated
from
their
parents
.

Family
visits
were
allowed
on
Thursday
nights
and
Fridays
.

When
Iraq
invaded
Kuwait
,
many
of
these
girls
were
transported
to
Jordan
and
then
smuggled
to
various
countries
--
Germany
,
France
,
Canada
,
Denmark
,
England
,
the
United
States
--
where
they
were
raised
by
guardians
who
were
usually
Mujahedeen
supporters
.

When
they
were
18
or
19
,
many
of
them
decided
to
come
back
to
Iraq
and
fill
the
ranks
of
the
youngest
Mujahedeen
generation
.

Though
''
decided
''
is
probably
not
the
right
word
,
since
from
the
day
they
were
born
,
these
girls
and
boys
were
not
taught
to
think
for
themselves
but
to
blindly
follow
their
leaders
.

''
Every
morning
and
night
,
the
kids
,
beginning
as
young
as
1
and
2
,
had
to
stand
before
a
poster
of
Massoud
and
Maryam
,
salute
them
and
shout
praises
to
them
,
''
Nadereh
Afshari
,
a
former
Mujahedeen
deep
-
believer
,
told
me
.

Afshari
,
who
was
posted
in
Germany
and
was
responsible
for
receiving
Mujahedeen
children
during
the
gulf
war
,
said
that
when
the
German
government
tried
to
absorb
Mujahedeen
children
into
their
education
system
,
the
Mujahedeen
refused
.

Many
of
the
children
were
sent
to
Mujahedeen
schools
,
particularly
in
France
.

The
Rajavis
,
Afshari
went
on
to
say
,
''
saw
these
kids
as
the
next
generation
's
soldiers
.

They
wanted
to
brainwash
them
and
control
them
.
''

Which
may
explain
the
pattern
to
their
stories
:
a
journey
to
self
-
empowerment
and
the
enlightenment
of
self
-
sacrifice
inspired
by
the
light
and
wisdom
of
Maryam
and
Massoud
.

One
has
to
wonder
whether
the
bright
fellows
in
our
government
and
military
who
set
up
the
deals
with
these
people
do
n't
know
what
they
are
,
do
n't
care
,
or
know
perfectly
well

belongs
to
everyone
,
it
has
gotten
to
be
something
weirder
.

It
's
become
a
guardian
of
morality
--
not
church
morality
;
real
morality
.

Praise
be
:
Given
the
void
in
responsible
behavior
among
governments
,
police
,
educational
establishments
and
religions
,
the
task
of
guiding
our
youth
down
the
path
of
righteousness
has
fallen
to
...
Satan
"

Hmmmmmm
....................

The
people
who
carry
out
these
underground
arms
/
drugs
/
sex
trafficking
deals
are
trauma
based
mind
controlled
slaves
.

The
Moldovan
airline
is
Aerocom
,
and
yes
,
it
's
one
of
Victor
Bout
's
.

The
wikipedia
entry
for
Aerocom
is
just
a
stub
..
waiting
for
someone
to
put
some
information
into
it
....

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerocom

So
...
put
some
information
in
there
.

You
know
,
nature
hates
a
void
.
:)

Richard
,

i
agree
,
Hmmmmmm
.

How
are
chants
of
death
and
suicide
...
morality
.

What
about
Manson
's
tees
bearing
the
message
,
"
Kill
your
parents
"
.

And
were
the
Columbine
killers
acting
out
this
"
real
morality
"
when
they
indescriminately
murdered
their
classmates
.

They
were
death
metal
brainwashed
fans
,
literally
fulfilling
the
death
metal
paradigm
,
er
...
morality
.

(
not
church
morality
,
no
that
is
phoney
,
love
thy
neighbor
...
hell
no
,
kill
thy
neighbor
-
now
that
is
REAL
MORALITY
?????
)

So
,
hmmmm
indeed
.

I
detect
the
hissing
lisp
of
the
lying
serpent
in
this
article
.

The
deathly
inversion
of
truth
,
ala
satanism
.

I
think
the
jury
's
still
out
on
exactly
who
did
the
brainwashing
when
in
regard
to
the
Columbine
killers
.

Perhaps
we
should
look
at
the
death
metal
phenomenon
less
as
an
invitation
to
violence
than
as
a
couter-cultural
response
to
the
over
hypocrisy
of
a
large
percentage
of
the
'
Church
-
Morality
'
crowd
,
which
gives
a
lot
of
lip
service
to
loving
thy
neighbor
,
but
does
n't
apply
that
love
very
far
beyond
their
own
congregation
.

The
last
I
checked
,
the
Satanists
have
a
long
way
to
go
to
catch
up
with
the
death
and
destruction
dealt
out
by
self
-
proclaimed
(
though
false
)
Christians
.

Irony
is
dead
...
Long
live
Irony
!

That
's
it
.

I
'm
firing
my
editor
.

Well
,
it
's
not
as
simple
and
clear
cut
as
all
that
.

We
're
entering
into
some
interesting
and
perhaps
previously
unexplored
socio-political
-
spiritual
territory
here
that
may
require
further
examination
and
serious
introspection
.

The
Kevin
Coogan
publication
posted
on
the
previous
thread
might
serve
as
a
good
launching
point
for
further
discussion
.

The
following
quote
is
from
that
Coogan
article
:

Imaginary
evil
is
romantic
and
varied
;
real
evil
is
gloomy
,
monotonous
,
barren
,
boring
.

Imaginary
good
is
boring
;
real
good
is
always
new
,
marvelous
,
intoxicating
.

Starroute

I
would
n't
wonder
too
hard
.

The
answer
is
likely
D
:
all
of
the
above
,
due
to
this
being
a
complex
reality
we
live
in
.

But
to
me
,
without
question
,
they
often
know
perfectly
well
.

Here
is
a
thought
:
When
the
appartently
cognitively
functional
take
actions
that
seem
senseless
and
incompetent
,
it
is
a
most
certain
sign
that
they
have
ulterior
or
hidden
motives
.

They
trust
you
and
me
to
be
befuddled
by
their
actions
,
while
they
"
do
as
they
wilt
"
.

To
not
buying
the
BS

&
here
I
am
thinking
that
I
really
must
be
getting
old
.

Since
the
article
was
specifically
about
"
death
metal
"
I
guess
the
author
missed
this
little
tidbit
or
we
just
have
waaaaaaaaaaaaay
different
definitions
of
morality
:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4446342.stm

One
man
's
relentless
search
for
his
missing
son
led
him
to
uncover
one
of
the
most
shocking
crimes
in
post-war
Italy
-
a
tale
of
satanism
and
violence
that
has
gripped
the
country
for
more
than
a
year
.

In
January
1998
Fabio
Tollis
and
Chiara
Marino
,
both
just
16
,
disappeared
.

They
had
been
drinking
at
a
pub
called
the
Midnight
-
the
centre
of
the
heavy
metal
scene
in
Milan
-
and
they
never
came
home
.

The
police
and
many
of
their
friends
just
thought
they
had
run
off
together
.

But
their
parents
refused
to
accept
this
.

Michele
Tollis
,
Fabio
's
father
,
began
to
attend
metal
concerts
and
festivals
across
Europe
,
handing
out
leaflets
and
quizzing
Fabio
's
friends
.

Fabio
and
his
friends
were
into
the
most
extreme
forms
of
heavy
metal
music
-
death
metal
and
black
metal
,
music
obsessed
with
images
of
murder
and
satanism
-
and
the
role
of
this
music
is
central
to
the
story
.

No
one
can
contradict
me
when
I
say
that
heavy
metal
and
satanism
are
closely
linked

Michele
Tollis

It
emerged
that
Chiara
,
the
girl
who
disappeared
with
Fabio
,
had
a
collection
of
satanic
literature
and
paraphernalia
in
her
bedroom
.

During
this
search
,
Michele
Tollis
became
convinced
that
satanism
had
something
to
do
with
his
son
's
disappearance
.

"
No
one
can
contradict
me
when
I
say
that
heavy
metal
and
satanism
are
closely
linked
.

They
're
inseparable
,
"
he
says
.

Yeah
,
I
think
Jeff
wrote
on
one
of
his
posts
here
in
the
past
several
months
:
"
To
hell
with
death
"
.

I
wholly
agree
,
and
would
expand
that
statement
to
include
:
"
To
hell
with
death
metal
"
.

The
freaky
thing
here
is
that
these
bozos
are
seriously
claiming
the
moral
high
ground
?
?
?
?
?

Talk
about
a
beat
-
your
-
head
-
against
-
the
-
wall
moment
!

And
for
'
Smartwolf
'
above
,
think
about
the
inversion
principle
being
employed
.

They
are
doing
it
deliberately
.

Do
you
really
think
GWB
,
and
neocons
in
general
are
representative
of
true
followers
of
Jesus
of
Nazareth
?

(
I
know
,
ignorant
question
)
Then
why
call
them
,
or
any
other
phonies
'
Christians
'
,
even
if
they
themselves
claim
the
appellation
.

They
are
merely
imposters
.

Everything
they
claim
is
a
lie
,
and
this
above
all
.

So
why
even
credit
their
claims
?

This
only
serves
their
purposes
.

They
want
to
be
identified
as
'
Christians
'
,
and
I
fully
suspect
that
for
some
of
them
,
the
motivation
behind
their
subterfuge
is
more
than
mere
political
advantage
,
and
has
a
lot
more
to
do
with
the
black
magician
's
practice
of
the
inversion
principle
.

We
need
to
be
more
'
rigorous
'
about
how
we
perceive
these
people
.

See
them
as
they
are
,
not
for
what
they
claim
to
be
.

...
the
most
extreme
forms
of
heavy
metal
music
-
death
metal
and
black
metal
,
music
obsessed
with
images
of
murder
and
satanism
-
and
the
role
of
this
music
is
central
to
the
story
.

Almost
all
of
the
avant
guard
art
movements
of
the
early
20th
Century
(
except
for
Italian
Futurism
)
were
labeled
'
degenerate
'
by
the
National
Socialists
.

Adolf
Hitler
even
held
an
exhibition
of
'
degenerate
art
'
in
1937
,
while
curating
a
parallel
show
of
'
Aryan
'
art
across
the
street
.

The
German
Expressionist
movement
was
destroyed
as
a
result
.

Here
's
a
quick
overview
of
the
Entartete
Kunst
(
Degenerate
Art
)
exhibit
of
1937
:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art

Ironically
(
or
perhaps
not
)
,
the
notion
of
the
'
degenerate
'
and
'
degenerate
art
'
was
appropriated
by
the
Nazis
and
its
origins
can
be
traced
back
to
Jewish
'
intellectual
'
Max
Nordau
and
a
1892
book
he
authored
called
Degeneration
.
.

Nordau
was
also
the
co
founder
of
the
World
Zionist
Organization
.

When
the
apparently
cognitively
functional
take
actions
that
seem
senseless
and
incompetent
,
it
is
a
most
certain
sign
that
they
have
ulterior
or
hidden
motives
.

They
trust
you
and
me
to
be
befuddled
by
their
actions
,
while
they
"
do
as
they
wilt
.
"

A
question
:

Are
the
adherent
of
'
Crowleyan
Thelema
'
and
others
of
similar
ilk
appropriating
or
appropriating
from
the
appropriators
to
redirect
'
energy
?
'

Does
this
reappropriation
lead
to
or
originate
from
the
same
place
?

Seems
as
if
there
is
a
clear
distinction
being
made
between
the
'
imaginary
'
Whore
of
Babalon
and
the
actually
Whore
of
Babylon
,
which
is
this
global
system
.

Is
the
distinction
accurate
and
valid
?

Does
the
distinction
actually
exist
?

This
is
where
the
socio
-
political
aspect
of
this
conundrum
comes
into
play
.

Confused
?

Good
.

so
,
enemy
,
what
's
your
point
?

Why
do
n't
you
state
it
?

My
point
is
that
these
are
all
just
questions
and
I
am
undecided
as
to
the
answers
.

Here
's
another
interesting
example
:

John
Balance
from
Coil
.

(
Do
n't
wish
to
use
Wikipedia
again
,
it
's
just
easier
than
spending
time
looking
up
more
obscure
and
detailed
information
.
)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Balance

http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1371372,00.html

Balance
died
in
2004
after
a
'
fall
.
'

He
blended
belief
systems
such
as
Shamanism
,
Christianity
,
Buddhism
,
Paganism
,
Hermeticism
and
Gnosticism
and
imbued
Coil
's
vast
output
with
a
magickal
current
designed
to
have
a
functionally
transcendent
effect
on
listeners
.

Not
200,000
guns
-
the
numbers
do
nt
work
:

5
kg
per
gun
,
200,000
guns
means
1000
tonnes
,
impossible
for
4
containers
.

If
the
load
was
99
tonnes
there
were
probably
less
than
20,000
.

E@tG
:

Maybe
if
you
formulate
your
questions
a
little
more
specifically
it
will
help
you
in
acquiring
the
answers
.

"
I
am
,
therefore
I

:)

Reporting
from
the
town
where
Susan
Polk
's
trial
is
going
on
.

I
went
across
the
bay
last
night
to
attend
a
farmer
's
market
and
music
event
.

Lo
and
behold
,
the
Mormons
were
there
with
a
booth
.

Two
young
men
delivering
information
about
the
Mormon
genealogy
program
.

Just
give
your
email
and
/
or
phone
number
to
these
guys
and
they
'll
track
down
your
family
.

I
was
amazed
at
the
spiel
they
delivered
.

Kindly
young
men
,
but
utterly
programmed
and
brain
-
dead
.

I
resisted
asking
any
questions
that
would
have
required
either
of
them
to
think
.

It
would
have
been
too
painful
to
watch
.

Has
anyone
read
the
letter
purportedly
from
Ahmadinejad
to
George
Bush
?

http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/article.asp?id=4503

I
do
n't
know
if
this
has
been
verified
.

But
succintly
making
point
after
succint
point
,
the
text
of
the
letter
stands
on
its
own
merit
,
regardless
.

I
like
to
imagine
the
thought
processes
going
on
in
W
's
head
if
he
were
to
actually
read
the
letter
,
but
it
is
hard
to
picture
him
actually
reading
this
letter
.

As
I
read
the
letter
,
I
considered
the
vast
contrast
between
mind
and
morality
of
whoever
wrote
it
,
vs.
that
of
the
mind
of
the
man
who
once
said
"
Bring
it
on
!
"

America

your

is
dire

In
scanning
the
whitehouse.gov
site
today
,
I
noticed
the
following
Executive
Order
:

Executive
Order
:
Amendments
to
Executive
Orders
11030
,
13279
,

,

,
and

,
and
***
Revocation

of
Executive
Order
13011
....

I
ca
n't
believe
there
are
no
serious
metal
fans
who
frequent
RI
.

I
'm
wary
of
jumping
into
this
fray
without
backup
,
that
's
for
damn
sure
.
:)

I
'm
a
regular
poster
but
for
some
reason
blogger
wo
n't
let
me
in
today
...
but
sign
me
TroubleFunk
.

Tronicus
:

Simply
,
the
questions
permeate
the
entire
'
Western
(
Mystery
)
Tradition
'
and
perhaps
'
Eastern
'
as
well
,
as
they
relate
to
the
confluence
of
politics
and
spirituality
.

For
example
,
is
the
system
of
Crowleyan
Thelema
a
failed
alchemical
process
?

Or
was
it
supposed
to
initially
be
a
process
of
alchemical
appropriation
?

Similarly
,
is
invoking
ancient
Egyptian
gods
and
goddesses
a
reaffirmation
of
an
oppressive
and
hierarchical
system
?

In
my
opinion
,
people
can
no
longer
afford
to
partition
out
and
compartmentalize
personal
spiritual
and
political
systems
.

The
'
high
weirdness
'
and
more
hardcore
political
'
factions
'
must
perhaps
integrate
and
arrive
at
a
synthesis
.

In
regards
to
death
metal
,
the
problem
is
,
once
again
,
a
question
of
education
,
history
and
the
vacuous
lack
of
perspective
in
American
culture
.

Shall
we
censor
the
works
of
poet
Charles
Baudelaire
as
well
?

Baudelaire
was
perhaps
one
of
the
first
'
death
metal
'
artists
.

Tronicus
,
if
you
're
still
checking
this
thread
:

A
bit
of
a
knee
-
jerk
reaction
from
me
there
,
and
I
apologize
for
my
over-generalizations
.

My
real
problem
is
with
literalist
fundamentalists
,
of
any
religion
.

True
believers
are
dangerous
animals
.

I
just
get
hung
up
on
'
Christians
'
,
as
they
're
the
dominant
form
where
I
come
from
.

Also
,
I
'm
quite
clear
on
the
fact
that
those
in
power
now
(
and
,
in
general
,
most
anyone
at
the
top
of
a
pyrimidal
power
structure
)
tend
to
use
the
dominant
religion
as
a
cloak
to
hide
their
true
motivations
and
as
a
tool
to
control
the
masses
.

It
boggles
the
mind
that
ANYONE
can
take
at
face
value
Bush
's
claims
to
be
a
christian
,
yet
many
seem
to
do
just
that
.

I
seem
to
remember
something
about
'
by
their
works
shall
ye
know
them
.
"

I
do
get
my
hackles
up
a
bit
when
people
haul
out
the
old
'
Rock
-
N
-
Roll
made
them
do
it
'
argument
.

Whie
I
do
n't
subscribe
to
the
notion
that
the
things
we
watch
or
listen
to
have
no
effect
on
our
behavior
(
which
I
think
is
patently
rediculous
)
,
it
does
bother
me
when
people
single
out
a
specific
group
of
people
to
pin
the
blame
on
.

Sub-cultures
(
as
the
lable
implies
)
do
not
develope
in
a
vacuum
.

Again
,
I
think
the
problem
is
people
who
sink
to
far
into
their
own
egos
,
and
begin
to
take
their
personal
metaphors
a
bit
too
literaly
.

These
people
are
dangerous
wether
they
're
head
-
banging
to
'
Canibal
Corpse
'
or
humming
along
to
'
Onward
Christian
Soldiers
'
.

(
The
mixing
of
religion
and
militarism
is
a
whole
other
topic
....
)

I
have
nothing
but
respect
for
people
who
adhear
to
non-violence
,
forgiveness
,
and
charity
,
but
it
's
important
to
remember
that
Christians
(
or
'
Smartwolves
'
)
do
not
have
a
monopoly
on
that
particular
lifestyle
.

Peace
.

The
fact
that
the
US
government
and
media
are
having
a
hissy
fit
over
Venezuela
wanting
to
buy
guns
,
and
then
200,000
of
the
guns
Chavez
wants
to
buy
go
missing
on
their
way
to
Iraq
is
definitely
sus
.

I
guess
those
guns
will
be
located
enroute
to
Venezuela
or
found
in
storage
there
by
one
of
the
US
's
local
stooges
and
they
then
have
a
pretext
to
ramp
the
spin
up
a
notch
or
two
.

Though
I
am
loathe
to
quote
other
writers
at
legnth
in
this
space
,
this
little
bit
from
Dan
Froomkin
's
"
White
House
Briefing
"
column
in
the
WashPost
today
is
just
too
good
to
pass
up
(
read
the
whole
column
here
)
:

At
the
Ask
the
President
event
on
Friday
,
one
of
the
questions
was
about
whether
Bush
has
any
thoughts
about
his
memoirs
.

This
is
one
example
of
what
happens
when
Bush
gets
a
question
that
he
has
n't
anticipated
.

"
Q
Thank
you
--
I
was
wondering
,
there
's
a
lot
of
talk
right
now
about
memoirs
being
written
with
the
former
President
.

After
you
are
elected
in
2004
,
what
will
your
memoirs
say
about
you
,
what
will
the
title
be
,
and
what
will
the
main
theme
say
?

"
THE
PRESIDENT
:
I
appreciate
that
.

(
Laughter
.
)

There
is
a
painting
on
my
wall
in
the
Oval
--
first
of
all
,
I
do
n't
know
.

I
'm
just
speculating
now
.

I
really
have
n't
thought
about
writing
a
book
.

My
life
is
too
complicated
right
now
trying
to
do
my
job
.

(
Laughter
.
)

But
if
--
there
's
a
painting
on
the
wall
in
the
Oval
Office
that
shows
a
horseman
charging
up
a
steep
cliff
,
and
there
are
at
least
two
other
horsemen
following
.

It
's
a
Western
scene
by
a
guy
named
W.H.S.
Koerner
called
'
A
Charge
to
Keep
.
'

It
's
on
loan
,
by
the
way
,
from
a
guy
named
Joe
O'Neill
in
Midland
,
Texas
.

He
was
the
person
,
he
and
his
wife
Jan
,
introduced
--
reintroduced
me
and
Laura
in
his
backyard
in
July
of
1977
.

Four
months
later
,
we
were
married
.

So
he
's
got
a
--
I
'm
a
decision
-
maker
and
I
can
make
good
decisions
.

(
Applause
.
)

"
And
so
we
sang
this
hymn
--
this
is
a
long
story
trying
to
get
to
your
answer
.

(
Laughter
.
)

This
is
not
a
filibuster
.

(
Laughter
.
)

That
's
a
Senate
term
--
particularly
on
good
judges
.

(
Applause
.
)

The
hymn
was
sung
at
my
first
inaugural
church
service
as
governor
.

Laura
and
I
are
Methodists
.

One
of
the
Wesley
boys
wrote
the
hymn
.

The
painting
is
based
upon
the
hymn
called
,
'
A
Charge
to
Keep
.
'

I
have
.

The
hymn
talks
about
serving
something
greater
than
yourself
in
life
.

I
--
which
I
try
to
do
,
as
best
as
I
possibly
can
.

(
Applause
.
)

"
The
book
--
I
guess
one
way
,
one
thing
to
think
about
it
is
--
one
of
the
themes
would
be
,
I
was
given
a
charge
to
keep
.

And
I
gave
it
all
my
heart
,
all
my
energy
,
based
upon
principles
that
did
not
change
once
I
got
into
the
Oval
Office
.

(
Applause
.
)
"

Now
that
's
a
rambling
response
.

And
I
have
to
wonder
:
Did
he
forget
that
he
already
has
a
memoir
called
"
A
Charge
to
Keep
"
?

That
was
the
name
of
his
"
autobiography
"
--
ghost
-
written
by
adviser
Karen
Hughes
in
1999
.

Important
news
such
as
President
Bush
's
miniscule
calibrations
on
his
marriage
amendment
/
anti-gay
(
update
:
he
's
not
against
gays
in
the
bedroom
,
just
at
the
altar
,
where
of
course
their
relationships
should
not
only
be
frowned
upon
but
should
be
constitutionally
excluded
)
has
pushed
Sudan
not
just
off
the
front
pages
,
or
the
A
section
,
but
out
of
the
NY
Times
and
Washington
Post
completely
.

I
had
to
go
to
the
BBC
for
this
report
.

It
's
symptomatic
,
I
suppose
,
of
our
fast
-
paced
,
24
hour
news
-
cycle
lives
,
that
the
biggest
short
-
term
humanitarian
crisis
in
the
world
would
quickly
be
eclipsed
,
once
our
Secretary
of
State
was
finished
with
his
whirlwind
tour
,
from
the
newspapers
.

It
's
just
disappointing
.

Most
troubling
,
however
,
is
the
fact
that
the
political
will
to
end
the
crisis
expressed
a
few
short
weeks
ago
seems
to
have
ebbed
.

At
that
time
,
UN
Secretary
General
Kofi
Annan
demanded
steps
be
taken
to
end
the
ethnic
violence
in
Darfur
within
48
hours
.

Two
weeks
later
,
and
the
violence
continues
.

The
African
Union
is
clearly
not
up
to
the
task
of
keeping
the
peace
,
pledging
300
troops
to
an
area
that
will
need
15,000
,
according
to
analysts
.

And
international
donors
have
given
only
half
of
the
relief
aid
that
Darfur
needs
,
according
to
the
local
UN
officials
.

So
hear
we
are
,
two
weeks
later
,
after
that
dazzling
PR
display
two
weeks
ago
by
Powell
and
Annan
,
and
the
situation
on
the
ground
in
Darfur
appears
basically
unchanged
.

The
hottest
item
on
Christmas
wish
lists
this
year
is
nuclear
weapons
.

Al
-
Qaeda
wants
them
,
Iran
wants
them
,
Russia
wants
the
better
ones
,
and
all
the
US
wants
is
to
give
them
all
a
piece
of
coal
.

For
the
last
few
years
there
have
been
tensions
with
Iran
's
nuclear
program
with
word
coming
this
week
that
a
deal
was
reached
through
the
European
Union
that
meets
with
the
approval
of
the
International
Atomic
Energy
Agency
.

At
the
same
time
,
an
Iranian
Opposition
Group
released
what
they
call
proof
of
a
covert
nuclear
weapons
program
.

Arial
photos
,
loose
connections
to
AQ
Kahn
and
Libya
make
up
the
evidence
that
the
group
presented
.

Russia
also
announced
that
it
was
seeking
and
building
the
best
nukes
the
world
's
ever
seen
.

President
Vladimir
Putin
said
Russia
is
will
have
new
nuclear
weapons
that
other
countries
do
not
and
will
not
have
.

With
the
demand
so
high
,
the
question
arises
on
to
who
should
be
or
has
the
right
to
be
the
Santa
of
nuclear
weapons
.

Right
now
that
seems
to
be
the
US
,
EU
,
and
IAEA
.

But
not
always
do
those
three
agree
,
and
not
always
are
their
decisions
equal
.

The
US
has
strongly
opposed
a
nuclear
weapons
program
of
Iran
,
yet
Israel
,
which
to
this
day
has
never
officially
said
that
they
posses
nuclear
weapons
,
ranks
around
fifth
in
nuclear
strength
.

It
is
estimated
that
Israel
has
over
200
nuclear
weapons
yet
neither
the
US
nor
any
of
her
allies
expresses
the
slightest
concern
.

North
Korea
's
Kim
Jong
Ill
also
has
the
bomb
at
the
top
of
his
list
and
Santa
seems
to
have
already
come
a
few
years
ago
.

It
is
rumored
that
North
Korea
has
at
least
a
couple
nuclear
weapons
.

But
getting
past
who
should
get
them
,
is
who
has
them
,
and
who
is
really
close
.

The
case
against
Iran
has
a
feeling
of
Deja
vu
.

Arial
photos
of
the
lab
were
uranium
is
being
enriched
,
somewhat
like
those
of
chemical
weapons
stockpiles
in
Iraq
.

America
cried
wolf
in
Iraq
,
and
what
's
scary
is
that
sooner
or
later
,
that
wolf
will
probably
get
us
.

What
if

Morphed
Into

What
if
Google

into
a

What
do
the
new
al
-
Qaeda
videotape
and
audio
speeches
of
Bin
Laden
and
Ayman
al
-
Zawahiri
tell
us
about
the
hopes
of
the
remaining
top
leadership
of
the
organization
?

Because
the
US
and
Pakistan
have
managed
to
capture
or
kill
about
2
/
3s
of
the
top
25
al
-
Qaeda
commanders
,
the
middle
managers
are
not
in
close
contact
with
al
-
Zawahiri
and
Bin
Laden
.

The
tape
was
a
way
to
signal
priorities
.

These
are
1
)
Assassinate
or
overthrow
Gen.
Pervez
Musharraf
,
the
Pakistani
military
"
president
"
who
had
made
a
coup
in
1999
and
has
thrown
in
his
lot
with
the
United
States
against
the
Taliban
and
al
-
Qaeda
.

Musharraf
has
been
trying
to
purge
his
officer
corps
of
the
substantial
number
of
al
-
Qaeda
sympathizers
.

His
military
intelligence
has
captured
major
figures
like
Abu
Zubayda
and
Khalid
Shaykh
Muhammad
,
as
well
as
nearly
500
other
al
-
Qaeda
operatives
,
over
400
of
whom
the
Pakistanis
have
turned
over
to
the
US
.

Musharraf
held
elections
in
October
of
2002
,
in
which
center
-
right
parties
did
well
,
but
in
which
nearly
20
percent
of
parliament
seats
went
to
the
fundamentalist
religious
party
coalition
,
MMA
.

MMA
also
captured
the
Northwest
Frontier
Province
,
which
probably
shelters
Bin
Laden
and
al
-
Zawahiri
,
and
is
in
a
joint
government
of
Baluchistan
Province
,
also
on
the
Afghanistan
border
.

If
al
-
Qaeda
can
kill
Musharraf
or
instigate
a
military
coup
against
him
by
Islamist
junior
officers
,
they
can
hope
to
catapult
the
MMA
to
power
as
political
allies
and
hosts
.

They
would
thereby
gain
control
of
a
major
base
for
terrorist
operations
,
which
is
also
a
nuclear
power
.

All
this
is
highly
unlikely
,
as
with
most
al
-
Qaeda
crackpot
schemes
.

But
so
was
it
unlikely
that
a
small
group
of
Arab
mujahidin
would
virtually
take
over
Afghanistan
.

Response
:
The
US
must
do
whatever
it
can
to
strengthen
the
legitimacy
of
the
Pakistani
government
.

On
the
one
hand
,
it
should
pressure
Musharraf
to
take
off
his
uniform
and
run
for
president
in
a
fair
election
,
and
to
repeal
the
contentious
"
Legal
Framework
Order
"
that
essentially
perpetuates
his
dictatorship
.

On
the
other
,
restrictions
should
be
lifted
on
the
mainstream
Muslim
League
-
N
and
Pakistan
People
's
Party
,
who
can
defeat
the
MMA
in
fair
elections
if
not
hogtied
by
the
secret
police
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
US
should
strong
-
arm
India
and
Pakistan
into
a
final
settlement
of
the
Kashmir
issue
.

Al
-
Zawahiri
attempted
to
use
Musharraf
's
lack
of
progress
in
helping
the
Muslims
of
that
Indian
state
as
a
justification
for
his
overthrow
.

The
Kashmir
issue
generates
far
more
terrorism
,
and
even
the
threat
of
nuclear
war
,
than
Iraq
ever
did
.

2
)
Target
Israel
and
encourage
the
worst
elements
of
the
Palestinians
by
playing
on
the
iron
fist
policies
of
the
Sharon
government
.

Response
:
The
US
has
succeeded
in
politically
isolating
Hamas
,
and
started
the
process
of
cutting
off
its
funding
.

This
terrorist
organization
can
now
only
pull
off
far
less
sophisticated
bombings
and
attacks
.

It
should
continue
to
be
defanged
.

But
Sharon
's
iron
fist
is
simply
not
working
as
a
means
of
establishing
general
peace
,
and
the
Bush
administration
will
have
to
finally
apply
effective
pressure
on
Sharon
to
stop
his
outrages
in
and
colonization
of
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
.

Sharon
's
hard
line
has
worked
in
tandem
with
Hamas
's
terrorism
to
ratchet
up
tensions
further
and
further
,
which
spill
over
into
the
Muslim
world
and
serve
as
a
recruiting
tool
for
al
-
Qaeda
in
its
search
for
agents
willing
to
hit
the
United
States
.

Israel
owes
the
United
States
at
least
this
much
,
in
this
crisis
,
to
cease
militarily
unnecessary
provocations
and
establish
genuine
peace
.

3
)
Make
Iraq
another
Afghanistan
,
using
the
Republican
Right
's
own
tactics
against
them
.

Response
:
Iraq
is
actually
hostile
territory
for
al
-
Qaeda
,
and
without
Iraqi
sympathizers
it
can
not
succeed
there
.

By
moving
quickly
to
Iraqi
sovereignty
and
improvement
of
Iraqi
lives
,
the
US
may
be
able
to
get
Iraqis
on
its
side
,
so
that
they
turn
in
the
foreigners
.

Certainly
,
the
Shiites
already
hate
al
-
Qaeda
and
would
help
;
likewise
the
Kurds
.

The
problem
of
mollifying
the
Sunnis
,
though
,
has
to
be
solved
to
avoid
giving
al
-
Qaeda
an
entree
.

The
Americans
have
to
put
away
their
free
-
market
fetishism
for
a
while
and
find
ways
of
creating
jobs
and
pumping
money
into
Iraqi
households
.

We
need
an
FDR
in
Iraq
,
not
a
Ronald
Reagan
.

Of
course
,
the
sooner
the
US
soldiers
can
be
withdrawn
in
favor
of
less
-
provocative
local
or
international
forces
,
the
better
.

Getting
the
Spanish
out
of
Iraq
is
n't
nearly
as
good
a
rallying
cry
for
al
-
Qaeda
in
the
Arab
world
as
getting
the
Americans
and
British
out
.

The
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
Sunni
Arab
nationalists
and
Baathists
and
local
Sunni
radicals
are
likely
to
remain
far
more
dangerous
to
the
US
in
Iraq
than
al
-
Qaeda
infiltrators
,
and
it
would
be
dangerous
to
take
one
's
eyes
off
the
former
ball
.

Angry
crowds
chanted
anti-American
slogans
in
the
western
city
of
Falluja
(
pop.
256,000
)
as
the
security
police
killed
in
a
friendly
fire
incident
by
US
troops
were
buried
on
Saturday
.

Reuters
reported
that
"
Sunni
clerics
in
the
town
issued
a
'
Declaration
by
the
people
of
Fallujah
'
condemning
the
deaths
of
the
security
guards
and
police
,
announcing
three
days
of
mourning
,
and
calling
for
a
general
strike
today
.
"

It
read
,
"
The
people
of
Fallujah
condemn
the
massacre
which
was
committed
on
Friday
against
people
dedicated
to
the
protection
of
Fallujah
.

Let
aggressive
(
American
)
leaders
and
soldiers
know
that
we
are
capable
of
protecting
the
city
's
security
and
safety
,
and
ask
them
to
lift
their
hands
from
the
city
.
"

The
clerics
demanded
talks
with
local
US
commanders
.

Falluja
has
long
been
roiled
by
tense
relations
with
the
US
soldiers
there
,
since
local
Sunnis
either
remain
committed
to
Arab
nationalism
or
have
become
Sunni
fundamentalists
or
even
radicals
.

Cities
such
as
Falluja
received
special
treatment
from
Saddam
and
enjoyed
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
country
's
wealth
and
power
.

They
know
that
the
American
advent
implies
for
them
a
demotion
,
and
an
elevation
of
the
Shiites
and
Kurds
,
and

In
the
eastern
city
of
Baqubah
,
guerrillas
detonated
a
car
bomb
outside
a
police
station
,
killing
several
people
.

The
US
lost
yet
another
helicopter
to
hostile
fire
near
Habbaniyah
in
the
Sunni
heartland
,
but
this
time
the
crew
was
safe
.

In
Fallujah
,
hundreds
of
demonstrators
came
out
against
US
troops
when
they
briefly
arrested
a
yound
newlywed
bride
.

(
I
hope
that
the
US
army
got
an
enormous
amount
of
information
from
her
relatives
,
because
otherwise
this
move
was
a
bad
,
bad
tradeoff
)
.

The
US
troops
fired
into
the
hostile
crowd
,
killing
4
.

It
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
manhunt
for
high
Baath
officials
in
the
Sunni
heartland
is
being
done
wrong
,
or
at
least
in
ways
that
are
bad
for
US
standing
with
local
Iraqis
.

Xinhua
reports
that
a
wide
range
of
Iraqi
political
forces
on
Tuesday
condemned
Sharon
's
murder
of
Sheikh
Ahmed
Yassin
,
a
religious
leader
of
Hamas
,
the
day
before
.

The
Board
of
Muslim
clerics
in
Fallujah
,
50
km
west
of
Baghdad
,
"
condemned
the
assassination
and
promised
immediate
revenge
against
the
coalition
soldiers
in
Iraq
.
"

Ash
-
Sharq
al
-
Awsat
reports
that
Fallujah
was
closed
Tuesday
in
a
general
strike
.

US
troops
there
clashed
with
guerrillas
in
a
fight
that
left
one
Iraqi
dead
.

In
Ramadi
,
there
was
a
big
demonstration
.

Radical
Shiite
cleric
Muqtada
al
-
Sadr
said
the
attack
was
"
criminal
"
and
that
"
the
Zionists
have
left
only
one
choice
for
the
Arabs
,
that
of
fighting
and
jihad
"
.

The
interim
Governing
Council
issued
a
communique
saying
,
"
It
is
a
proof
of
the
emptiness
of
the
Israeli
authority
and
a
destruction
of
the
peace
endeavors
in
the
region
.
.
.

This
operation
would
only
consolidate
the
terrorist
acts
in
the
world
and
would
not
bring
peace
to
the
region
,
"
the
message
claimed
.

Xinhua
alleged
that
"
Many
of
the
Iraqis
,
who
suffer
the
American
occupation
of
Iraq
,
relate
their
case
with
that
of
the
Palestinian
people
,
under
the
Israeli
occupation
.
"

In
an
apparently
unrelated
incidents
,
some
eleven
Iraqis
were
killed
by
snipers
on
Tuesday
,
including
a
group
of
police
trainees
in
a
bus
near
Hilla
and
two
police
in
Kirkuk
.

The
Coalition
decision
to
provoke
a
fight
with
Muqtada
al
-
Sadr
's
movement
only
three
months
before
the
Coalition
Provisional
Authority
goes
out
of
business
has
to
be
seen
as
a
form
of
gross
incompetence
in
governance
.

How
did
the
CPA
get
to
the
point
where
it
has
turned
even
Iraqi
Shiites
,
who
were
initially
grateful
for
the
removal
of
Saddam
Hussein
,
against
the
United
States
?

Where
it
risks
fighting
dual
Sunni
Arab
and
Shiite
insurgencies
simultaneously
,
at
a
time
when
US
troops
are
rotating
on
a
massive
scale
and
hoping
to
downsize
their
forces
in
country
?

At
a
time
when
the
Spanish
,
Thai
and
other
contingents
are
already
committed
to
leaving
,
and
the
UN
is
reluctant
to
get
involved
?

One
answer
is
that
the
Pentagon
prevented
the
State
Department
from
running
the
CPA
.

State
is
the
body
with
experience
in
international
affairs
and
administration
.

The
civilians
in
the
Department
of
Defense
only
know
how
to
blow
things
up
.

Rumsfeld
,
Wolfowitz
and
Feith
staffed
the
CPA
with
Neoconservatives
,
most
of
whom
had
no
administrative
experience
,
no
Arabic
,
and
no
respect
for
Muslim
culture
(
or
knowledge
about
it
)
.

They
actively
excluded
State
Department
Iraq
hands
like
Tom
Warrick
.

(
Only
recently
have
a
few
experienced
State
Department
Arabists
been
allowed
in
to
try
to
begin
mopping
up
the
mess
.
)

The
Neocons
in
the
CPA
have
all
sorts
of
ulterior
motives
and
social
experiments
they
want
to
impose
on
the
Iraqi
people
,
including
Polish
-
style
economic
shock
therapy
,
some
sort
of
sweetheart
deal
for
Israel
,
and
maybe
even
breaking
the
country
up
into
three
parts
.

The
Washington
Monthly
's
Who
's
Who
of
Neocons
in
Iraq
helps
explain
the
extreme
incompetence
and
possibly
double
-
dealing
of
many
in
the
CPA
.

Sept.
11
Commission
member
Philip
Zelikow
,
who
is
close
to
the
Bush
administration
,
admitted
on
Sept.
10
,
2002
,
that
the
ulterior
motive
of
the
Bush
administration
for
the
Iraq
War
was
to
"
protect
Israel
,
"
according
to
the
Asian
Times
.

I
have
long
been
a
trenchant
critic
of
the
Sadrists
.

But
they
have
n't
been
up
to
anything
extraordinary
as
far
as
I
can
see
in
recent
weeks
.

Someone
in
the
CPA
sat
down
and
thought
up
ways
to
stir
them
up
by
closing
their
newspaper
and
issuing
28
arrest
warrants
and
taking
in
people
like
Yaqubi
.

This
is
either
gross
incompetence
or
was
done
with
dark
ulterior
motives
that
can
scarcely
be
guessed
at
.

There
is
a
classical
logical
fallacy
,
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
(
Z
happens
after
X
,
therefore
Z
is
caused
by
X
)
,
and
I
keep
revising
this
posting
this
evening
because
I
do
n't
want
to
fall
into
it
.

But
sometimes
,
of
course
,
when
Z
happens
after
X
it
is
because
of
X
.

So
I
may
as
well
just
come
out
with
it
:
It
is
pretty
suspicious
,
given
the
Neocon
predominance
in
the
CPA
and
in
the
upper
reaches
of
the
Defense
Department
that
on
April
2
AP
reported
of
Muqtada
:

'
A
radical
Shiite
Muslim
cleric
has
expressed
solidarity
with
the
militant
Palestinian
group
Hamas
and
said
that
he
should
be
considered
the
group
's
"
striking
arm
"
in
Iraq
.

"
I
have
said
and
I
repeat
my
expression
of
solidarity
which
Hassan
Nasrallah
called
for
to
stand
with
Hamas
,
"
Shiite
cleric
Muqtada
al
-
Sadr
said
Friday
in
a
reference
to
Nasrallah
,
the
leader
of
the
militant
Lebanese
Shiite
group
Hezbollah
.

Last
month
,
Nasrallah
announced
that
his
party
would
close
ranks
with
Hamas
.

"
Let
(
Hamas
)
consider
me
their
striking
arm
in
Iraq
because
the
fate
of
Iraq
and
Palestine
is
the
same
,
"
al
-
Sadr
said
during
a
Friday
prayer
sermon
in
Kufa
,
his
home
base
south
of
Baghdad
.

He
did
comment
on
what
he
meant
by
the
phrase
.
'

And
on
April
3
his
chief
aide
in
Najaf
was
suddenly
arrested
along
with
13
other
members
of
his
organization
,
and
the
Coalition
forces
are
put
into
violent
conflict
with
his
organization
,
which
leaves
7
US
soldiers
dead
.

The
Army
is
unlikely
to
forgive
or
forget
;
but
who
provoked
it
and
why
?

I
'm
not
even
in
Iraq
and
I
could
have
predicted
to
you
the
consequences
of
doing
what
the
CPA
has
been
doing
.

Anthony
Shadid
of
the
Washington
Post
reveals
that
the
warrants
for
the
arrests
had
been
issued
months
be
for
.

Why
were
they
suddenly
acted
on
Saturday
?

From
Friday
's
Daily
Star

By
Juan
Cole

Friday
,
June
04
,
2004

As
the
American
public
gradually
wearies
of
the
Iraq
crisis
,
some
have
begun
worrying
that
the
war
could
blow
back
on
the
US
by
creating
the
conditions
for
anti-American
terrorism
.

Israel
,
however
,
is
much
closer
to
Iraq
and
is
likely
to
suffer
from
Iraqi
instability
much
more
acutely
than
will
the
United
States
.

Ironically
,
among
the
strongest
proponents
of
war
in
Iraq
were
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ariel
Sharon
and
his
neoconservative
supporters
in
the
US
.

Have
they
,
however
,
actually
weakened
Israeli
security
?

The
biggest
threat
Israel
faces
is
not
from
conventional
armies
but
from
the
asymmetrical
tactics
of
Palestinian
national
liberation
movements
.

The
derailing
of
the
Oslo
peace
process
by
the
hard
-
line
policies
of
Sharon
and
the
Palestinian
intifada
has
encouraged
suicide
bombings
.

This
,
in
turn
,
has
discouraged
international
investment
in
Israel
and
has
made
it
less
likely
that
immigrants
to
the
country
will
actually
remain
there
.

Although
Israel
withdrew
from
Lebanese
territory
in
May
2000
,
the
radical
Lebanese
Shiite
party
,
Hizbullah
,
has
not
been
mollified
.

It
is
estimated
to
have
some
5,000
armed
fighters
,
and
they
have
pursued
attacks
against
Israeli
forces
to
compel
them
to
withdraw
from
the
Shebaa
Farms
,
a
sliver
of
Syrian
territory
that
Israel
annexed
after
the
1967
war
.

Any
thorough
assessment
of
the
impact
of
the
Iraq
war
and
its
aftermath
on
Israel
's
security
environment
must
,
therefore
,
closely
examine
its
likely
effect
on
the
conduct
of
asymmetrical
warfare
.

Although
it
is
often
alleged
(
without
much
evidence
)
that
Saddam
Hussein
gave
money
to
the
families
of
Palestinian
suicide
bombers
and
so
encouraged
asymmetrical
warfare
,
it
is
not
clear
that
he
actually
posed
a
danger
to
Israel
.

The
Palestinians
who
have
been
willing
to
kill
themselves
to
end
the
Israeli
occupation
of
the
Gaza
Strip
and
the
West
Bank
were
not
driven
by
economic
considerations
.

Saddam
never
did
anything
practical
to
help
the
Palestinians
.

At
some
points
,
as
in
the
late
1980s
,
he
reportedly
made
behind
-
the
-
scenes
overtures
to
the
Israelis
to
arrive
at
some
sort
of
a
deal
.

He
did
not
allow
Palestinian
radicals
to
launch
operations
against
Israel
from
Iraq
.

By
the
late
1990s
,
Iraq
had
no
nuclear
or
biological
weapons
program
,
and
had
destroyed
its
chemical
weapons
stockpiles
.

Its
ramshackle
army
had
virtually
collapsed
before
the
American
invasion
in
2003
.

If
it
is
hard
to
see
how
Baathist
Iraq
posed
any
real
threat
to
Israel
,
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
see
a
menace
in
the
current
instability
.

The
bungling
of
post-war
Iraq
by
the
Bush
administration
created
a
weak
and
failed
state
.

Armed
militias
,
many
staffed
by
former
Iraqi
military
men
with
substantial
training
and
experience
,
have
proliferated
.

The
US
chose
to
ally
itself
with
such
groups
as
the
Supreme
Council
for
the
Islamic
Revolution
in
Iraq
,
whose
15,000
-
strong
Badr
Corps
paramilitary
was
trained
by
the
Iranian
Revolutionary
Guards
.

Anti-Israeli
and
pro-Palestinian
feeling
is
strong
among
several
major
Iraqi
ideological
groups
and
currents
.

The
more
radical
Shiites
,
who
generally
follow
the
theocratic
notions
of
Iran
's
Ayatollah
Ruhollah
Khomeini
,
routinely
chant
and
demonstrate
against
Israel
.

They
vehemently
protested
the
Israeli
assassination
of
Sheikh
Ahmed
Yassin
,
the
leader
of
Hamas
,
last
March
.

Worse
for
Israel
,
the
assassination
drew
a
denunciation
even
from
the
moderate
and
cautious
Grand
Ayatollah
Ali
Sistani
,
who
wields
enormous
moral
authority
over
Iraqi
Shiites
.

These
Shiite
movements
had
been
suppressed
by
Saddam
Hussein
's
regime
,
but
have
now
organized
and
armed
themselves
.

They
have
also
reestablished
their
historical
links
with
Lebanese
and
Iranian
Shiites
.

It
is
inevitable
that
most
Iraqi
Shiites
will
side
with
their
Hizbullah
coreligionists
against
Israel
,
and
it
seems
likely
that
Iraqi
Shiites
will
get
rich
enough
from
Iraqi
petroleum
sales
in
the
future
that
they
will
be
in
a
good
position
to
bankroll
Lebanese
Shiite
radicals
.

Sunni
Arab
fundamentalists
deeply
sympathize
with
the
Palestinians
and
with
Hamas
,
and
those
in
Iraq
have
deep
historical
inks
with
fundamentalists
in
Jordan
and
Palestine
.

Iraqi
cities
such
as
Fallujah
and
Ramadi
were
on
the
truck
route
from
Amman
to
Baghdad
,
and
so
came
under
the
influence
of
the
Salafi
movement
,
which
is
popular
in
Jordan
.

Secular
Arab
nationalist
groups
also
universally
sympathize
with
the
Palestinians
,
and
those
in
post-Saddam
Iraq
are
no
exception
.

Whereas
Saddam
Hussein
's
dictatorship
ensured
that
such
populist
currents
were
kept
firmly
under
control
,
they
are
now
free
to
organize
.

An
Iraq
in
which
armed
fundamentalist
and
nationalist
militias
proliferate
is
inevitably
a
security
worry
for
Israel
.

If
even
a
modicum
of
normality
and
security
can
be
returned
to
Iraq
,
its
citizens
will
be
able
to
benefit
from
the
country
's
petroleum
reserves
.

That
private
wealth
can
easily
be
funneled
into
aid
for
the
Palestinians
and
for
Lebanese
Shiites
.

Israel
's
security
interests
are
best
served
by
peace
with
its
neighbors
,
which
can
only
be
achieved
by
trading
land
for
peace
with
the
Palestinians
.

Ariel
Sharon
's
aggressive
near
annexation
of
almost
half
of
the
occupied
West
Bank
and
his
indefinite
postponement
of
any
Palestinian
state
have
created
unprecedented
rage
and
violence
.

The
anger
has
spread
throughout
the
Muslim
world
,
including
Iraq
.

The
promotion
by
the
pro-Zionist
right
of
twin
occupations
-
in
the
West
Bank
and
in
Iraq
-
has
profoundly
weakened
,
not
strengthened
,
Israeli
security
.

that

WASHINGTON
(
CNN
)
--

Texas
Gov.
George
W.
Bush
is
enduring
sharp
criticism
for
being
unable
to
name
the
leaders
of
four
current
world
hot
spots
,
but
President
Bill
Clinton
says
Bush
"
should
,
and
probably
will
,
pick
up
"
those
names
.

The
front

runner
for
the
2000
Republican
presidential
nomination
faltered
Thursday
in
an
international
affairs
pop
quiz
posed
by
Andy
Hiller
,
a
political
reporter
for
WHDH
-
TV
in
Boston
.

Bush

Hiller
asked
Bush
to
name
the
leaders
of
Chechnya
,
Taiwan
,
India
and
Pakistan
.

Bush
was
only
able
to
give
a
partial
response
to
the
query
on
the
leader
of
Taiwan
,
referring
to
Taiwanese
President
Lee
Teng
-
hui
simply
as
"
Lee
.
"

He
could
not
name
the
others
.

"
Can
you
name
the
general
who
is
in
charge
of
Pakistan
?
"

Hiller
asked
,
inquiring
about
Gen.
Pervaiz
Musharraf
,
who
seized
control
of
the
country
October
12
.

"
Wait
,
wait
,
is
this
50
questions
?
"
asked
Bush
.

Hiller
replied
:
"
No
,
it
's
four
questions
of
four
leaders
in
four
hot
spots
.
"
.
.
.

Bush
,
in
answering
the
question
about
the
leader
of
Pakistan
,
also
said
:
"
The
new
Pakistani
general
,
he
's
just
been
elected
--
not
elected
,
this
guy
took
over
office
.

It
appears
this
guy
is
going
to
bring
stability
to
the
country
and
I
think
that
's
good
news
for
the
subcontinent
.
"

Gore
released
a
statement
Friday
taking
Bush
to
task
for
his
comments
on
Pakistan
's
recent
coup
.

"
I
find
it
troubling
that
a
candidate
for

in
our
country
--
the
world

--
would
characterize
the
military
takeover
as
"
good
news
,
"
Gore
said
.

"
Further
,
I
find
it
even
more
disturbing
that
he
made
these
comments
about
a
nation
that
just
last
year
tested
nuclear
weapons
--
shortly
after
voicing
his
public
opposition
to
the
Comprehensive
Test
Ban
Treaty
.

A
spokesman
for
President
Clinton
also
criticized
Bush
's
comments
.

"
It
is
very
dangerous
for
this
country
to
condone
the
overthrow
of
democratically
elected
governments
,
"
said
David
Leavy
,
spokesman
for
the
National
Security
Council
.

Not
only
did
Bush
not
know
who
General
Pervez
Musharraf
was
,
he
seems
to
have
confused
coup
-
making
with
"
taking
office
,
"
and
moreover
went
on
to
suggest
that
the
overthrow
of
an
elected
prime
minister
and
the
installation
in
power
of
the
Pakistan
military
,
then
the
world
's
strongest
supporter
of
the
Taliban
,
would
bring
"
stability
!
"

Musharraf
made
his
coup
in
part
because
of
the
military
's
anger
over
Prime
Minister
Nawaz
Sharif
's
willingness
to
back
down
from
confronting
India
over
Kashmir
,
so
that
he
explicitly
came
to
power
as
a
warmonger
.

I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
ominous
I
found
Bush
's
performance
in
that
interview
.

I
still
remember
him
stuttering
about
"
the
General
,
"
unable
to
remember
Musharraf
's
name
.

He
obviously
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about
,
though
he
demonstrated
a
number
of
ill
-
fated
instincts
.

He
obviously
liked
authoritarian
rule
better
than
democracy
,
equating
dictatorship
with
"
stability
.
"

And
,
he
did
n't
think
he
needed
to
know
anything
about
South
Asia
,
with
its
nuclear
giants
and
radical
religious
politics
--
the
latter
a
dire
security
threat
to
the
US
.

He
could
n't
tell
when
things
were
becoming
more
unstable
as
opposed
to
less
.

Musharraf
went
on
to
play
nuclear
brinkmanship
with
India
in
2002
,
risking
war
twice
that
year
.

Although
Musharraf
did
turn
against
the
Taliban
after
September
11
,
under
extreme
duress
from
the
US
,
elements
of
his
military
continued
to
support
radical
Islamism
and
have
recently
been
implicated
in
assassination
attempts
on
Musharraf
himself
.

This
was
the
body
that
Bush
proclaimed
was
bringing
"
stability
"
to
the
region
in
fall
of
1999
.

So
,
one
answer
to
Bush
's
charge
about
Edwards
is
that
if
it
had
any
merit
,
Bush
should
have
declined
to
run
himself
.

Another
answer
is
that
Edwards
certainly
knows
far
more
about
foreign
affairs
now
than
Bush
did
then
.

Indeed
,
given
how
Bush
has
rampaged
around
the
world
alienating
allies
and
ignoring
vital
conflicts
with
the
potential
to
blow
back
on
the
US
,
one
might
well
argue
that
Edwards
knows
more
now
than
Bush
does
.

This
is
what
Edwards
'
campaign
literature
said
about
his
positions
:
"
Edwards
believes
that
the
U.S.
must
be
an
active
leader
to
help
resolve
conflicts
,
from
reducing
tensions
between
India
and
Pakistan
to
the
peace
process
in
Northern
Ireland
.

Edwards
is
a
strong
supporter
of
Israel
,
and
believes
that
the
U.S.
has
a
vital
role
in
promoting
peace
between
the
Israelis
and
the
Palestinians
.
"

I
do
n't
see
Bush
doing
any
of
this
.

The
September
11
Panel
will
issue
its
findings
on
Thursday
.

It
notes
10
points
at
which
the
US
made
key
mistakes
that
might
have
stopped
Bin
Laden
's
plot
.

Four
of
these
were
under
Clinton
and
6
under
Bush
.

Bush
came
out
today
and
said
that
if
he
had
known
what
was
coming
,
he
would
have
expended
every
effort
to
stop
it
,
and
that
so
would
have
Clinton
.

This
statement
is
,
despite
its
facade
of
fair
-
mindedness
,
so
many
weasel
words
.

Of
course
Bush
would
have
tried
to
stop
9/11
if
he
had
known
it
was
coming
.

The
question
is
,
"
Should
he
have
known
it
was
coming
?
"

The
answer
is
,
"
Yes
!
"

We
now
know
that
Bush
and
his
administration
came
into
office
obsessed
with
Iraq
.

Cheney
was
looking
at
maps
of
Iraq
oil
fields
and
muttering
about
opportunities
for
US
companies
there
,
already
in
January
or
February
of
2001
.

Wolfowitz
contradicted
counter-terrorism
czar
Richard
Clarke
when
the
latter
spoke
of
the
al
-
Qaeda
threat
,
insisting
that
the
preeminent
threat
of
terrorism
against
the
US
came
from
Iraq
,
and
indicating
he
accepted
Laurie
Mylroie
's
crackpot
conspiracy
theory
that
Saddam
was
behind
the
1993
World
Trade
Towers
bombing
.

If
you
believe
crackpot
theories
instead
of
focusing
on
the
reality
--
that
was
an
al
-
Qaeda
operation
mainly
carried
out
by
al
-
Gamaa
al
-
Islamiyyah
,
an
Egyptian
terrorist
component
allied
with
Bin
Laden
--
then
you
will
concentrate
on
the
wrong
threat
.

Even
after
the
attacks
on
September
11
,
Bush
was
obsessing
about
Iraq
.

Wolfowitz
lied
to
him
and
said
that
there
was
a
10
to
50
%
chance
that
Iraq
was
behind
them
.

(
On
what
evidence
?

The
hijackers
were
obviously
al
-
Qaeda
,
and
no
operational
links
between
al
-
Qaeda
and
Iraq
had
ever
been
found
)
.

Rumsfeld
initially
rejected
an
attack
on
al
-
Qaeda
bases
in
Afghanistan
,
saying
there
were
"
no
good
targets
"
in
Afghanistan
.

(
What
about
40
al
-
Qaeda
bases
that
had
trained
the
9/11
hijackers
and
other
terrorists
gunning
for
the
United
States
??
)

The
Pentagon
did
not
even
have
a
plan
for
dealing
with
Afghanistan
or
al
-
Qaeda
that
it
could
pull
off
the
shelf
,
according
to
Bob
Woodward
.

Bush
did
not
have
his
eye
on
the
ball
.

Neither
did
Cheney
,
Rumsfeld
,
or
Wolfowitz
.

They
were
playing
Captain
Ahab
to
Saddam
's
great
white
whale
.

Imperial
Hubris
makes
the
case
that
lots
of
people
in
the
CIA
and
counter-terrorism
divisions
elsewhere
in
the
US
government
knew
all
about
Bin
Laden
and
the
threat
he
posed
.

They
were
from
all
accounts
marginalized
and
not
listened
to
.

Bush
demoted
Dick
Clarke
,
among
the
most
vocal
and
focused
of
the
al
-
Qaeda
experts
,
from
his
cabinet
.

Dick
could
never
thereafter
get
any
real
cooperation
from
the
cabinet
officers
,
who
outranked
him
,
and
he
could
not
convince
them
to
go
to
battle
stations
in
the
summer
of
2001
when
George
Tenet
's
hair
was
"
on
fire
"
about
the
excited
chatter
the
CIA
was
picking
up
from
radical
Islamist
terrorists
.

As
for
the
Clinton
administration
,
let
me
say
one
thing
in
its
defense
.

Clinton
had
worked
out
a
deal
with
Pakistani
Prime
Minister
Nawaz
Sharif
in
summer
of
1999
that
would
have
allowed
the
US
to
send
a
Special
Ops
team
in
after
Bin
Laden
in
Qandahar
,
based
from
Pakistan
.

I
presume
you
need
the
Pakistan
base
for
rescue
operations
in
case
anything
went
wrong
.

You
also
need
Pakistani
air
space
.

The
plan
was
all
set
and
could
have
succeeded
.

But
in
fall
of
1999
,
Gen.
Pervez
Musharraf
made
a
coup
against
Nawaz
Sharif
.

The
Pakistani
army
was
rife
with
elements
protective
of
the
Taliban
,
and
the
new
military
government
reneged
on
the
deal
.

Musharraf
told
Clinton
he
could
n't
use
Pakistani
soil
or
air
space
to
send
the
team
in
against
Bin
Laden
.

Look
at
a
map
and
you
try
to
figure
out
how
,
in
fall
of
1999
,
you
could
possibly
pull
off
such
an
operation
without
Pakistani
facilities
.

Of
course
,
you
could
just
go
in
by
main
force
.

But
for
those
of
you
tempted
in
that
direction
,
please
look
up
Carter
's
Tabas
operation
.

It
should
be
easily
googled
.

Clinton
tried
,
and
tried
hard
.

The
gods
were
n't
with
us
on
that
one
.

The
debate
that
a
handful
of
Texas
multi-millionnaires
close
to
the
Bush
family
have
cleverly
manufactured
over
John
Kerry
's
war
record
is
absurd
in
every
way
.

The
charges
that
they
have
put
some
vets
up
to
making
against
Kerry
are
false
and
can
be
demonstrated
by
the
historical
record
to
be
false
.

Most
of
those
making
the
charges
have
even
flip
-
flopped
,
contradicting
themselves
.

Or
they
were
n't
eyewitnesses
and
are
just
lying
.

But
to
address
the
substance
of
this
Big
Lie
is
to
risk
falling
into
its
logic
.

The
true
absurdity
of
the
entire
situation
is
easily
appreciated
when
we
consider
that
George
W.
Bush
never
showed
any
bravery
at
all
at
any
point
in
his
life
.

He
has
never
lived
in
a
war
zone
.

If
some
of
John
Kerry
's
wounds
were
superficial
,
Bush
received
no
wounds
.

(
And
,
a
piece
of
shrapnel
in
the
forearm
that
caused
only
a
minor
wound
would
have
killed
had
it
hit
an
eye
and
gone
into
the
brain
;
the
shrapnel
being
in
your
body
demonstrates
you
were
in
mortal
danger
and
did
n't
absent
yourself
from
it
.

That
is
the
logic
of
the
medal
)
.

Kerry
saved
a
man
's
life
while
under
fire
.

Bush
did
no
such
thing
.

What
was
Bush
doing
with
his
youth
?

He
was
drinking
.

He
was
drinking
like
a
fish
,
every
night
,
into
the
wee
hours
.

For
decades
.

He
gave
no
service
to
anyone
,
risked
nothing
,
and
did
not
even
slack
off
efficiently
.

The
history
of
alcoholism
and
possibly
other
drug
use
is
a
key
issue
because
it
not
only
speaks
to
Bush
's
character
as
an
addictive
personality
,
but
may
tell
us
something
about
his
erratic
and
alarming
actions
as
president
.

His
explosive
temper
probably
provoked
the
disastrous
siege
of
Fallujah
last
spring
,
killing
600
Iraqis
,
most
of
them
women
and
children
,
in
revenge
for
the
deaths
of
4
civilian
mercenaries
,
one
of
them
a
South
African
.

(
Newsweek
reported
that
Bush
commanded
his
cabinet
,
"
Let
heads
roll
!
"
)

That
temper
is
only
one
problem
.

Bush
has
a
sadistic
streak
.

He
clearly
enjoyed
,
as
governor
,
watching
executions
.

His
delight
in
killing
people
became
a
campaign
issue
in
2000
when
he
seemed
,
in
one
debate
,
to
enjoy
the
prospect
of
executing
wrong
-
doers
a
little
too
much
.

He
has
clearly
gone
on
enjoying
killing
people
on
a
large
scale
in
Iraq
.

Drug
abuse
can
affect
the
ability
of
the
person
to
feel
deep
emotions
like
empathy
.

Two
decades
of
pickling
his
nervous
system
in
various
highly
toxic
substances
have
left
Bush
damaged
goods
.

Even
for
those
who
later
abstain
,
"
visual
-
spatial
abilities
,
abstraction
,
problem
solving
,
and
short
-
term
memory
,
are
the
slowest
to
recover
.
"

That
he
managed
to
get
on
the
wagon
(
though
with
that
pretzel
incident
,
you
wonder
how
firmly
)
is
laudable
.

But
he
suffers
the
severe
effects
of
the
aftermath
,
and
we
are
all
suffering
along
with
him
now
,
since
he
is
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
.

We
all
know
by
now
that
Bush
did
not
even
do
his
full
service
with
the
Texas
Air
National
Guard
,
absenting
himself
to
work
on
the
Alabama
senate
campaign
of
Winton
"
Red
"
Blount
.

Whether
he
was
actually
AWOL
during
this
stint
is
unclear
.

But
it
is
clear
that
not
only
did
Bush
slack
off
on
his
National
Guard
service
,
but
he
slacked
off
from
his
campaign
work
.

This
little
-
noted
interview
with
Blount
's
nephew
Murph
Archibald
,
which
appeared
on
National
Public
Radio

gives
a
devastating

was

have
to
suffer

Bush
in

March
30
,
2004
Tuesday

This
campaign
season
,
there
have
been
questions
about
whether
George
W.
Bush
fulfilled
his
obligations
to
the
National
Guard
as
a
young
lieutenant
in
the
early
1970s
.

For
weeks
,
reporters
scoured
Alabama
in
search
of
pilots
or
anyone
who
might
have
remembered
seeing
Mr.
Bush
at
the
time
he
was
serving
in
the
National
Guard
there
.

There
is
one
place
in
Alabama
where
Mr.
Bush
was
present
nearly
every
day
:
the
headquarters
in
Montgomery
of
US
Senate
candidate
Winton
"
Red
"
Blount
.

President
Bush
has
always
said
that
working
for
Blount
was
the
reason
he
transferred
to
the
Alabama
Air
National
Guard
.

NPR
's
Wade
Goodwyn
has
this
report
about
Mr.
Bush
's
time
on
that
campaign
.

WADE
GOODWYN
reporting
:

In
1972
,
Baba
Groom
was
a
smart
,
funny
young
woman
smack
-
dab
in
the
middle
of
an
exciting
US
Senate
campaign
.

Groom
was
Republican
Red
Blount
's
scheduler
,
and
in
that
job
,
she
was
the
hub
in
the
campaign
wheel
.

Ask
her
about
the
handsome
young
man
from
Texas
,
and
she
remembers
him
32
years
later
like
it
was
yesterday
.

Ms.
BABA
GROOM
(
Former
Campaign
Worker
)
:

He
would
wear
khaki
trousers
and
some
old
jacket
.

He
was
always
ready
to
go
out
on
the
road
.

On
the
phone
,
you
could
hear
his
accent
.

It
was
a
Texas
accent
.

But
he
just
melded
with
everybody
.

GOODWYN
:
The
candidate
Mr.
Bush
was
working
for
,
Red
Blount
,
had
gotten
rich
in
Alabama
in
the
construction
business
.

Prominent
Southern
Republicans
were
something
of
a
rare
breed
in
those
days
.

Blount
's
support
of
the
party
led
him
to
be
appointed
Richard
Nixon
's
postmaster
general
.

In
Washington
,
Blount
became
friends
and
tennis
partners
with
Mr.
Bush
's
father
,
then
Congressman
Bush
.

That
was
how
26
-
year
-
old
Lieutenant
Bush
came
to
Montgomery
,
at
his
father
's
urging
.
.
.

It
was
Mr.
Bush
's
job
to
organize
the
Republican
county
chairpersons
in
the
67
Alabama
counties
.

Back
in
1972
in
the
Deep
South
,
many
rural
counties
did
n't
have
much
in
the
way
of
official
Republican
Party
apparatus
.

But
throughout
Alabama
,
there
were
Republicans
and
Democrats
who
wanted
to
help
Red
Blount
.

It
was
the
young
Texan
's
job
to
find
out
what
each
county
leader
needed
in
the
way
of
campaign
supplies
and
get
those
supplies
to
them
.

Groom
says
this
job
helped
Mr.
Bush
understand
how
even
in
a
statewide
Senate
campaign
,
politics
are
local
.

.
.
.
Murph
Archibald
is
Red
Blount
's
nephew
by
marriage
,
and
in
1972
,
he
was
coming
off
a
15
-
month
tour
in
Vietnam
in
the
infantry
.

Archibald
says
that
in
a
campaign
full
of
dedicated
workers
,
Mr.
Bush
was
not
one
of
them
.

Mr.
MURPH
ARCHIBALD
(
Nephew
of
Red
Blount
)
:
Well
,
I
was
coming
in
early
in
the
morning
and
leaving
in
mid-evenings
.

Ordinarily
,
George
would
come
in
around
noon
;
he
would
ordinarily
leave
around
5:30
or
6:00
in
the
evening
.

GOODWYN
:
Archibald
says
that
two
months
before
the
election
,
in
September
of
'72
,
Red
Blount
's
campaign
manager
came
to
him
and
asked
that
he
quietly
take
over
Mr.
Bush
's
job
because
the
campaign
materials
were
not
getting
out
to
the
counties
.

Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
George
certainly
did
n't
seem
to
have
any
concerns
about
my
taking
over
this
work
with
the
campaign
workers
there
.

My
overall
impression
was
that
he
did
n't
seem
as
interested
in
the
campaign
as
the
other
people
who
were
working
at
the
state
headquarters
.

GOODWYN
:
Murph
Archibald
says
that
at
first
,
he
did
n't
know
that
Mr.
Bush
was
serving
in
the
Air
National
Guard
.

After
he
found
out
from
somebody
else
,
Archibald
attempted
to
talk
to
Mr.
Bush
about
it
.

The
president
was
a
lieutenant
and
Archibald
had
been
a
lieutenant
,
too
;
he
figured
they
had
something
to
talk
about
.

Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
George
did
n't
have
any
interest
at
all
in
talking
about
the
military
.

In
fact
,
when
I
broached
the
subject
with
him
,
he
simply
changed
the
subject
.

He
was
n't
unpleasant
about
it
,
but
he
just
changed
the
subject
and
would
n't
talk
about
it
.

GOODWYN
:
Far
from
Texas
and
Washington
,
DC
,
Mr.
Bush
enjoyed
his
freedom
.

He
dated
a
beautiful
young
woman
working
on
the
campaign
.

He
went
out
in
the
evenings
and
had
a
good
time
.

In
fact
,
he
left
the
house
he
rented
in
such
disrepair
--
with
damage
to
the
walls
and
a
chandelier
destroyed
--
that
the
Montgomery
family
who
owned
it
still
grumble
about
the
unpaid
repair
bill
.

Archibald
says
Mr.
Bush
would
come
into
the
office
and
,
in
a
friendly
way
,
offer
up
stories
about
the
drinking
he
'd
done
the
night
before
,
kind
of
as
a
conversation
starter
.

Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
People
have
different
ways
of
starting
the
days
in
any
office
.

They
're
going
to
talk
about
their
kids
,
they
're
going
to
talk
about
football
,
they
're
going
to
talk
about
the
weather
.

And
this
was
simply
his
opening
gambit
;
he
would
start
talking
about
that
he
had
been
out
late
the
night
before
drinking
.

GOODWYN
:
Archibald
says
the
frequency
with
which
Mr.
Bush
discussed
the
subject
was
off
-
putting
to
him
.

Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
I
mean
,
at
that
time
,
I
was
28
;
George
would
have
been
25
or
26
.

And
I
thought
it
was
really
unusual
that
someone
in
their
mid-20s
would
initiate
conversations
,
particularly
in
the
context
of
something
as
serious
as
a
US
senatorial
campaign
,
by
talking
about
their
drinking
the
night
before
.

I
thought
it
unusual
and
,
frankly
,
inappropriate
.

GOODWYN
:
According
to
Archibald
,
Mr.
Bush
would
also
sometimes
tell
stories
about
his
days
at
Yale
in
New
Haven
,
and
how
whenever
he
got
pulled
over
for
erratic
driving
,
he
was
let
go
after
the
officers
discovered
he
was
the
grandson
of
a
Connecticut
US
senator
.

Archibald
,
a
middle
-
class
Alabama
boy
--
who
,
by
the
way
,
is
now
a
registered
Democrat
--
did
n't
like
that
story
.

Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
He
told
us
whenever
he
was
stopped
,
as
soon
as
the
law
enforcement
found
out
that
he
was
the
grandson
of
Prescott
Bush
,
they
would
let
him
go
.

And
he
would
always
laugh
about
that
.
"

Goodwyn
dutifully
notes
that
Baba
Groom
did
n't
remember
George
telling
drunk
stories
.

But
that
means
nothing
,
since
they
were
n't
the
sort
of
things
guys
like
Bush
told
the
"
girls
"
.

He
was
trying
to
buddy
with
Archibald
and
impress
him
.

Again
,
decades
of
this
sort
of
behavior
do
not
leave
a
person
untouched
.

Our
world
is
in
crisis
and
our
Republic
is
in
danger
.

It
should
not
be
left
in
the
hands
of
a
man
who
spent
his
life
like
this
.

On
the
internet
site
of
Monotheism
and
Holy
War
(
al
-
Tawhid
wa
al
-
Jihad
)
,
the
group
allegedly
declared
,
"
We
announce
that
the
Tawhid
and
Jihad
Group
,
its
prince
and
soldiers
,
have
pledged
allegiance
to
the
sheikh
of
the
mujahideen
Osama
bin
Laden
.
"

This
pledge
is
a
new
development
.

Abu
Musab
al
-
Zarqawi
and
his
group
are
said
to
have
been
bitter
rivals
of
al
-
Qaeda
during
the
Afghan
resistance
days
.

One
witness
at
the
Moutasaddiq
trial
in
Germany
alleged
that
Zarqawi
had
not
allowed
Monotheism
and
Holy
War
to
share
resources
with
al
-
Qaeda
in
the
early
zeroes
of
the
21st
century
.

If
the
statement
is
true
,
it
is
a
worrying
sign
that
even
the
divided
small
radical
guerrilla
groups
are
being
"
picked
up
"
by
al
-
Qaeda
.

This
consolidation
is
obviously
a
result
of
Bush
's
aggressive
invasion
of
Iraq
and
of
the
botching
of
the
aftermath
.

It
is
a
setback
for
the
war
on
terror
.

Al
-
Qaeda
in
Afghanistan
was
a
group
of
only
a
few
hundred
"
Afghan
Arabs
"
who
pledged
personal
loyalty
to
Usamah
Bin
Laden
.

It
could
notionally
be
expanded
to
encompass
the
5,000
-
strong
"
55th
Brigade
"
of
the
Taliban
regime
,
though
this
is
not
the
technical
definition
.

Because
Usamah
is
Saudi
,
my
guess
is
that
they
were
especially
influenced
by
an
extremist
form
of
the
Wahhabi
school
of
Islam
that
predominates
among
Saudia
's
some
15
million
citizens
.

In
1998
they
were
joined
by
Egyptians
from
the
al
-
Jihad
al
-
Islami
group
of
Ayman
al
-
Zawahiri
(
many
of
these
were
from
Upper
Egypt
,
especially
Asyut
and
environs
)
.

After
that
point
,
al
-
Qaeda
was
a
joint
enterprise
between
the
Egyptian
extremists
and
the
polyglot
Arabs
around
Bin
Laden
,
only
some
of
whom
were
Saudi
.

Zarqawi
is
a
Jordanian
,
and
his
Monotheism
and
Holy
War
group
in
Afghanistan
probably
had
a
distinctive
coloration
as
mainly
Jordanian
,
Palestinian
and
Syrian
.

They
also
had
a
special
connection
to
some
extremists
in
Jordan
and
Germany
.

They
are
probably
especially
oriented
toward
the
Salafi
school
of
modern
Islamic
thought
,
which
has
a
Protestant
-
like
emphasis
on
going
back
to
the
original
practice
of
the
early
companions
of
the
Prophet
Muhammad
.

(
Most
Salafis
are
not
militant
or
violent
,
though
they
tend
to
be
rather
narrow
-
minded
in
my
experience
,
on
the
order
of
Protestant
Pietists
)
.

Monotheism
and
Holy
War
obviously
does
have
a
violent
interpretation
of
Salafism
,
rather
as
the
the
leaders
of
the
so
-
called
German
Peasant
Rebellion
among
early
Protestants
did
.

Another
worrisome
sign
is
that
local
Iraqi
Sunni
fundamentalists
opposed
to
the
US
presence
in
Iraq
have
begun
joining
Monotheism
and
Holy
War
,
and
wearing
its
distinctive
orange
and
black
insignia
.

These
have
been
sighted
among
Iraqi
crowds
on
Haifa
Street
in
Baghdad
and
in
Samarra
.

So
now
there
are
hundreds
of
al
-
Qaeda
members
in
Iraq
where
there
had
been
none
before
.

The
consolidation
of
smaller
local
radical
fundamentalist
groups
with
al
-
Qaeda
can
also
be
seen
in
the
case
of
the
Fizazi
group
in
Tangiers
that
morphed
into
the
Moroccan
Islamic
Combatant
Group
,
had
members
who
met
with
September
11
ringleader
Muhammad
Atta
,
and
ultimately
was
in
part
responsible
for
the
Madrid
train
bombings
.

The
Iraqi
Islamic
Party
lead
by
Muhsin
Abdul
Hamid
,
has
been
among
the
few
Sunni
Muslim
groups
willing
to
cooperate
(
even
if
rather
lukewarmly
)
with
the
Americans
.

It
is
now
threatening
to
pull
out
of
the
Allawi
caretaker
government
.

The
IIP
had
also
been
the
main
force
urging
Sunni
Arabs
to
participate
in
the
elections
scheduled
for
January
,
and
had
been
opposed
in
this
stance
by
the
Association
of
Muslim
Scholars
.

That
the
Iraqi
Islamic
Party
is
now
contemplating
leaving
the
Allawi
government
raises
the
question
of
whether
a
mass
Sunni
Arab
boycott
of
the
elections
is
in
the
offing
,
thus
fatally
weakening
the
legitimacy
of
any
new
government
.

Az
-
Zaman
:
The
Association
of
Muslim
Scholars
forbade
Iraqis
to
participate
in
the
attack
on
Fallujah
with
the
Americans
.

In
a
communique
,
the
AMS
said
that
for
Iraqis
to
take
part
with
"
raiding
forces
"
in
the
assault
on
a
city
,
the
population
of
which
is
Muslim
(
such
as
Fallujah
)
would
be
considered
the
most
mortal
of
mortal
sins
.

The
Sunni
AMS
told
Iraqis
,
"
You
sinned
when
you
participated
with
occupation
forces
in
the
assault
on
Najaf
,
and
beware
lest
you
repeat
this
same
sin
in
Fallujah
.

Remember
that
the
Occupation
is
emphemeral
.
"

The
radical
Shiite
Sadr
movement
issued
a
statement
forbidding
the
participation
of
Iraqi
troops
in
the
attack
on
Fallujah
,
as
well
.

The
statement
said
,
"
We
direct
an
appeal
at
the
men
in
the
Iraqi
forces
,
whether
national
guards
or
others
,
the
majority
of
whom
are
Muslim
,
calling
upon
them
to
refrain
for
commiting
this
enormous
sin
under
the
banner
of
forces
that
do
not
respect
our
religion
or
any
principles
of
basic
humanity
,
and
we
ask
them
to
view
this
war
as
illegal
.
"

It
called
a
"
ploy
"
the
assertaion
that
the
attack
was
merely
on
foreign
fighters
at
Fallujah
.

The
convergence
of
views
among
the
more
militant
Sunni
Muslim
clerics
of
AMS
and
the
radical
Shiites
of
the
Sadr
movement
has
been
seen
before
,
last
spring
during
the
initial
US
assault
on
Fallujah
and
during
the
US
attack
on
Mahdi
Army
militiamen
in
Najaf
.

Most
Shiites
,
however
,
are
still
reluctant
to
take
major
risks
to
support
the
Sunnis
of
Fallujah
,
many
of
whom
had
supported
Saddam
and
his
anti-Shiite
pogroms
.

US
Marines
moved
into
most
of
Fallujah
on
Wednesday
,
though
they
were
still
meeting
pockets
of
resistance
.

The
Fallujah
fighting
has
killed
fair
numbers
of
Iraqi
noncombatants
,
including
Shaikh
Abdul
Wahhab
al
-
Janabi
of
the
respected
Association
of
Muslim
Scholars
.

Armed
clashes
broke
out
in
several
northern
Iraqi
cities
on
Wednesday
,
leaving
some
22
persons
dead
in
Mosul
,
Baiji
,
and
Tuz
.

Hundreds
of
persons
mounted
demonstrations
against
the
Fallujah
campaign
in
Tikrit
and
Huwaijah
,
as
well
,
according
to
az
-
Zaman
.

The
battles
and
demonstrations
were
provoked
by
the
US
assault
on
Fallujah
.

Guerrillas
threatened
to
assassinate
Prime
Minister
Iyad
Allawi
and
Minister
of
Defense
Hazem
Shaalan
in
retaliation
for
the
attack
.

Allawi
's
aged
cousin
and
the
man
's
wife
and
daughter
-
in
-
law
were
abducted
and
guerrillas
threaten
to
behead
them
if
the
Fallujah
compaign
is
not
stopped
.

In
Iraqi
society
,
PM
Allawi
is
responsible
for
protecting
his
clan
,
including
especially
his
first
cousins
,
so
this
kidnapping
makes
him
look
weak
and
brings
substantial
shame
on
him
.

The
US
Marines
took
most
of
Fallujah
Wednesday
,
but
still
face
pockets
of
resistance
.

If
Samarra
and
other
cities
are
any
guide
,
those
pockets
of
resistance
could
go
on
bedeviling
the
US
for
some
time
to
come
.

The
intrepid
Ed
Wong
of
the
NYT
has
more
on
the
Sunni
boycott
of
the
elections
.

He
reports
that
the
Iraqi
Islamic
Party
,
which
had
earlier
been
absolutely
committed
to
getting
out
the
Sunni
vote
,
is
now
wavering
and
saying
their
position
will
depend
on
the
situation
.

The
outbreak
of
demonstrations
and
violence
throughout
the
Sunni
Arab
regions
on
Wednesday
did
not
bode
well
for
Sunni
participation
in
the
January
elections
.

Jim
Lobe
has
more
on
the
political
implications
of
the
Fallujah
assault
,
both
in
Iraq
and
in
Washington
.

My
opinion
piece
on
the
implications
of
Arafat
's
passing
for
al
-
Qaeda
has
appeared
at
Newsday
.

Excerpt
:

"
Arafat
's
secular
nationalism
was
supple
enough
to
compromise
with
Israel
and
to
imagine
a
two
-
state
solution
,
even
if
the
road
of
negotiations
remained
rocky
.

The
continued
Israeli
colonization
of
the
occupied
Palestinian
territories
during
the
1990s
helped
,
along
with
terrorist
attacks
by
radical
groups
such
as
Hamas
,
to
derail
the
peace
process
,
which
Sharon
had
always
opposed
.

Arafat
's
death
creates
a
vacuum
in
Palestinian
leadership
that
will
not
soon
be
filled
.

Sharon
's
assassination
of
major
Hamas
leaders
has
also
weakened
authority
structures
in
that
party
.

If
the
Israelis
and
the
Palestinian
leadership
can
not
find
a
way
to
reinvigorate
the
peace
process
,
cells
of
radical
young
Palestinians
may
grow
up
that
look
to
bin
Laden
for
their
cues
.

Even
if
local
Palestinian
leaders
remain
strong
enough
to
keep
al
-
Qaida
out
,
the
festering
Israeli
-
Palestinian
struggle
remains
among
the
best
recruiting
posters
for
al
-
Qaida
with
young
Muslim
men
.

Resolving
this
conflict
would
be
the
most
effective
weapon
the
United
States
could
deploy
in
its
war
on
terror
.

DPA
:
Iraqi
authorities
announced
that
they
had
busted
up
3
terrorist
cells
operating
in
Baghdad
.

Two
of
them
were
being
run
by
2
officials
of
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
!

The
MoI
in
Iraq
is
equivalent
to
the
US
FBI
,
so
this
would
be
like
having
J.
Edgar
Hoover
unwittingly
employ
at
a
high
level
members
of
the
Weathermen
bombers
back
in
the
1960s
.

The
third
was
being
run
by
the
head
of
an
investment
firm
.

You
wonder
if
he
was
manipulating
the
market
with
his
bombing
targets
.

The
cells
were
operating
in
the
Ghazaliyah
and
al
-
Jihad
districts
of
the
capital
.

Although
the
announcement
was
probably
made
to
show
progress
in
identifying
and
breaking
up
terror
cells
,
I
do
n't
find
the
news
that
the
Baathists
continue
to
penetrate
the
Iraqi
government
very
hopeful
.

It
reminds
me
too
much
of
the
ARVN
officers
who
were
secretly
working
for
the
other
side
in
Vietnam
.

Al
-
Zaman
:
Guerrillas
killed
a
member
of
the
Kurdistan
Democratic
Party
after
kidnapping
him
in
Mosul
.

The
police
commander
of
Ninevah
Province
announced
that
bombings
had
declined
80
percent
in
Mosul
,
whereas
there
had
been
a
big
jump
in
the
number
of
kidnappings
.

On
Wednesday
guerrillas
had
kidnapped
a
cosmetic
surgeon
and
his
wife
while
they
were
on
their
way
home
.

In
Suwayrah
,
Kut
Province
,
two
car
bombs
were
discovered
before
they
could
be
detonated
.

(
Kut
is
in
southeastern
Iraq
and
has
an
overwhelmingly
Shiite
population
,
who
are
on
the
lookout
for
Baathist
saboteurs
and
willingly
turn
them
in
.

This
willingness
is
the
main
difference
in
the
number
of
bombings
in
the
south
as
opposed
to
the
center
-
north
of
the
country
.

In
Baghdad
Kadhim
Talal
Husain
,
assistant
dean
at
the
School
of
Education
at
Mustansiriyah
University
,
was
assassinated
with
his
driver
in
the
Salikh
district
.

Guerrillas
killed
an
engineer
,
Asi
Ali
,
from
Tikrit
.

They
also
killed
Shaikh
Hamid
'Akkab
,
a
clan
elder
of
a
branch
of
the
Dulaim
tribe
in
Tikrit
.

His
mother
was
also
killed
in
the
attack
.

Two
other
Dulaim
leaders
have
been
killed
in
the
past
week
and
a
half
.

Guerrillas
near
Hawijah
launched
an
attack
that
left
6
dead
,
including
4
Iraqi
soldiers
.

One
of
them
was
from
the
Jubur
tribe
and
was
deputy
commander
of
the
Hawijah
garrison
.

Two
hundred
members
of
the
Batawi
clan
of
the
Dulaim
demonstrated
in
Baghdad
on
Friday
,
protesting
the
killing
of
their
clan
elder
,
Shaikh
Kadhim
Sarhid
and
4
of
his
sons
,
by
gunmen
wearing
Iraqi
army
uniforms
.

(
This
is
a
largely
Sunni
Arab
clan
,
and
some
Sunni
observers
have
accused
Shiite
elements
in
the
government
of
being
behind
the
assassination
;
it
is
more
likely
the
work
of
Sunni
Arab
guerrillas
punishing
the
Batawi
leaders
for
cooperating
with
the
Dec.
15
elections
.
)

Al
-
Zaman
:
The
Iraqi
High
Electoral
Commission
on
Friday
denied
a
request
of
the
Debaathification
Commission
to
exclude
51
individuals
from
running
on
party
lists
in
the
Dec.
15
elections
on
grounds
of
having
been
sufficiently
involved
in
Baath
activities
to
warrant
their
being
excluded
from
civil
office
.

The
Commission
said
it
had
no
legal
grounds
for
such
an
exclusion
.

This
item
is
a
small
one
and
easily
missed
.

But
in
my
view
it
is
highly
significant
.

The
Debaathification
Commission
had
been
pushed
by
Ahmad
Chalabi
and
his
Iraqi
National
Congress
very
hard
,
and
had
pushed
many
Sunni
Arabs
into
the
arms
of
the
guerrillas
.

Chalabi
has
been
increasingly
marginalized
within
Iraq
,
however
,
despite
his
ties
of
clientelage
with
Washington
and
Tehran
.

He
is
no
longer
in
the
dominant
Shiite
list
,
the
United
Iraqi
Alliance
,
and
wo
n't
have
many
seats
in
the
new
parliament
.

Some
2,000
junior
officers
of
the
old
Baath
army
have
been
recalled
to
duty
in
recent
months
,
something
Chalabi
would
have
blocked
if
he
could
have
.

Now
the
Electoral
Commission
is
refusing
to
punish
people
for
mere
past
Baath
Party
membership
.

The
situation
in
Iraq
is
only
going
to
get
better
this
way
.

If
someone
committed
a
crime
against
humanity
,
prosecute
the
person
.

If
he
or
she
did
not
,
then
they
should
have
all
the
same
rights
as
other
Iraqis
.

Al

reports
that
a
key
eyewitness
in
the
trial
of
Saddam
Hussein
for
a
1982
massacre
at
Dujail
has
died
.

A
team
from
the
court
managed
to
take
his
deposition
before
he
died
.

The
trial
begins
again
Nov.
28
.

Elena
's
motorcycle
tour
through
the
region
around
Chernobyl
has
revived
interest
in
one
of
the
most
serious
nuclear
disasters
in
history
.

We
all
know
what
happened
,
but
even
to
this
day
,
there
are
many
different
versions
and
opinions
on
how
it
happened
and
what
effect
Chernobyl
will
have
on
the
health
of
people
affected
by
the
fallout
.

UPDATE
:

Now
you
can
tour
Chernobyl
and
write
your
own
story
.

This
is
not
a
post
about
fault
-
finding
or
assigning
blame
.

It
is
a
time
to
learn
what
happened
and
how
it
may
affect
the
future
.

There
was
a
soothing
authoritative
UNSCEAR
(
United
Nations
Scientific
Committee
on
the
Effects
of
Atomic
Radiation
)
report
in
2000
on
the
health
effects
of
Chernobyl
confirming
that
there
was
no
scientific
evidence
of
any
significant
radiation
-
related
health
effects
to
most
people
exposed
.

This
was
heavily
promoted
by
the
Australasian
Radiation
Protection
Society
in
a
press
release
titled
THE
MYTHS
OF
CHERNOBYL
which
contained
the
following
:

One
of
the
most
widespread
myths
of
recent
times
is
that
the
Chernobyl
nuclear
reactor
accident
in
1986
caused
many
thousands
of
extra
cancer
deaths
in
neighbouring
regions
,
and
that
public
health
has
been
severely
affected
by
exposure
to
radiation
.

Many
people
still
believe
that
to
be
true
,
even
though
the
Ministry
of
Russian
Federation
on
Civil
Defence
,
Emergencies
and
Elimination
of
Conseguences
of
Natural
Disasters
(
EMERCOM
of
Russia
)
reported
this
in
1996
:

CHERNOBYL
ACCIDENT
:
TEN
YEARS
ON

In
the
last
decade
,
there
has
been
a
real
and
significant
increase
in
childhood
and
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
adult
carcinoma
of
the
thyroid
in
contaminated
regions
of
the
former
Soviet
Union
(
Wi940
)
which
should
be
attributed
to
the
Chernobyl
accident
until
proven
otherwise
.

The
prestigious
IAEA
(
International
Atomic
Energy
Agency
)
published
an
early
report
on
Chernobyl
which
was
based
on
information
from
Russian
sources
and
stated
that
there
was
no
significant
health
effects
.

However
,
in
April
2001
,
the
IAEA
published
Fifteen
Years
after
the
Chernobyl
Accident
-
Lessons
learned
.
which
contradict
the
earlier
reports
.

Here
are
some
excerpts
:

The
dramatic
increase
in
radiation
-
induced
thyroid
cancers
in
children
and
adolescents
in
Belarus
,
Russia
,
and
Ukraine
,
which
have
been
observed
since
1991
,
continues
to
this
day
.

...
a
drop
in
the
birth
rate
,
a
deterioration
in
women
's
reproductive
health
,
an
increase
in
complications
during
pregnancy
and
birth
,
and
a
deterioration
in
neonatal
health
....

The
dynamics
of
change
in
the
state
of
health
of
children
affected
by
the
Chernobyl
accident
in
all
three
countries
-
Belarus
,
Russia
,
and
Ukraine
-
in
the
post-accident
period
is
characterized
by
persistent
negative
tendencies
:
the
morbidity
rate
is
going
up
,
the
number
of
really
healthy
children
is
dropping
,
and
disability
is
increasing
.

As
a
parent
,
I
can
well
imagine
how
painful
it
must
be
for
those
families
whose
children
are
succumbing
to
radiation
poisoning
.

There
is
a
lot
to
learn
about
Chernobyl
.

Being
well
-
informed
will
give
you
certainty
and
that
is
desirable
in
a
world
of
conflicting
reports
.

There
are
a
wealth
of
references
on
Chernobyl
.

Read
some
of
the
following
links
and
draw
your
own
conclusions
.

These
links
present
the
many
viewpoints
that
existed
and
still
exist
about
the
disaster
called
Chernobyl

I
would
be
interested
in
hearing
what
conclusions
you
reached
and
what
you
found
that
was
most
convincing
.

radiation
:

As
a
child
in
the
50's
I
had
a
lot
of
glandular
problems
and
they
treated
it
with
radiation
therapy
(
primitive
at
best
!
)
and
stopped
when
a
lesion
on
my
neck
started
enlarging
--
they
said
it
was
not
CA
but
stopped
the
treatments
....

Remember
the
old
shoe
sizing
machines
that
was
a
form
of
radiation
xray
?

That
too
was
stopped
.

Do
n't
have
to
mention
what
radiation
has
done
and
is
still
doing
to
Hirsohima
&
Nagaski
folks
--
there
can
be
no
doubts
about
the
effects
of
radiation
in
Chernobyl
.......

The
Chernobyl
Children
's
Project
(
http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp
)
offers
several
ways
to
help
the
children
of
that
region
.

One
of
them
is
the
Rest
and
Recuperation
Program
,
wherein
a
child
can
come
to
the
US
for
a
few
weeks
in
the
summer
.

Even
a
little
time
spent
receiving
wholesome
,
uncontaminated
food
,
good
medical
care
,
etc.
can
add
years
to
their
lives
.

S.
and
I
have
an
acquaintance
who
has
hosted
several
of
these
children
for
many
years
;
to
see
these
little
ones
breaks
the
heart
.

The
urge
to
protect
and
gather
them
all
in
is
almost
overwhelming
,
and
makes
me
more
grateful
for
the
blessings
I
have
.

Take
care
,
my
friend
,
Linda

I
'm
sorry
to
say
Elena
's
story
has
been
revealed
to
be
a
fake
.

There
has
been
random
speculation
about
Google
developiong
a
new
browser
and
/
or
acquiring
Firefox
.

It
is
true
that
Google
has
been
in
acquisition
mode
.

They
have
acquired
Urchin
,
Zipdash
,
Applied
Semantics
,
Picasa
,
Blogger
,
and
satellite
imaging
company
Keyhole
,
so
why
not
Firefox
?

I
have
no
inside
information
,
but
I
have
been
following
links
today
that
strongly
indicate
that
Google
is
damn
serious
about
securing
permanent
control
of
the
leading
edge
browser
technology
in
Firefox
.

Ben
Goodger
is
the
lead
engineer
for
Mozilla
Firefox
.

He
announced
this
in
January
:

As
of
January
10
,
2005
,
my
source
of
income
changed
from
The
Mozilla
Foundation
to
Google
,
Inc.
of
Mountain
View
,
California
.

My
role
with
Firefox
and
the
Mozilla
project
will
remain
largely
unchanged
,
I
will
continue
doing
much
the
same
work
as
I
have
described
above
-
with
the
new
goal
of
successful
1.1
,
1.5
and
2.0
releases
.

I
remain
devoted
full
-
time
to
the
advancement
of
Firefox
,
the
Mozilla
platform
and
web
browsing
in
general
.

He
also
announced
this
in
January
:

Welcome

I
just
want
to
extend
a
big
"
Welcome

"
to
Darin
Darin

Following
on
the
heels
of
Ben
's
annoucement
yesterday
,
I
thought
I
'd
post
that
I
have
joined
Google
as
well
.

Like

I
will
still
be
very
much

Ben
made
another
announcement
on
March
28
,
2005
:

I
want
to
use
this
opportunity
to
welcome
Brian
Ryner
to
Google
!

Brian
has
been
one
of
the
most
crucial
elements
to
the
success
of
Mozilla
software
over
the
past
few
years
,
...

Great
to
have
you
on
board
!

Now
,
none
of
this
has
been
confirmed
by
Google
at
the
present
time
,
but
it
's
an
old
adage
that
you
follow
the
money
to
see
who
is
behind
something
.

In
this
case
,
following
the
talent
leads
me
to
think
that
Google
will
be
making
an
announcement
this
year
that
formalizes
the
Google
-
Mozilla
/
Firefox
relationship
.

If
you
have
not
already
seen
the
Flash
movie
Epic
,
you
should
take
a
few
minutes
and
view
the
future
history
of
media
as
conceived
by
Robin
Sloan
and
Matt
Thompson
,
with
music
by
Aaron
McLeran
.

In
this
movie
Google
and
Amazon
(
GOOGLEZON
)
create
a
brave
new
world
of
media
in
2008
.

This
is
one
thought
-
provoking
film
.

Every
move
Google
makes
brings
this
particular
future
closer
.

Just
one
small
commment
-
it
's
not
possible
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
for
Google
to
"
Aquire
"
Firefox
.

They
already
have
rights
to
take
it
,
alter
it
,
and
release
those
changes
to
the
world
-
this
is
what
the
whole
open
source
thing
is
about
.

I
'm
inclined
to
say
that
google
is
doing
what
they
can
to
both
shape
and
support
the
growth
of
the
most
popular
non-Microsoft
browser
out
there
-
by
taking
on
the
leading
lights
in
Firefox
development
,
they
're
ensuring
the
continued
life
of
the
project
,
and
ensuring
(
not
that
I
think
they
need
to
)
that
their
voice
will
be
heard
admidst
the
higher
echelons
of
the
firefox
development
team
.

It
's
this
sort
of
enlightened
self
interest
that
keeps
large
open
source
projects
alive
.

Fascinating
viewpoint
of
the
future
in
Epic
.

Thanks
for
the
link
.

Malach
,
What
you
say
makes
sense
.

Acquiring
open
source
talent
gives
a
company
an
inexpensive
way
of
influencing
and
anticipating
the
direction
an
open
source
project
will
go
.

It
probably
gives
more
bang
for
the
buck
than
acquiring
a
private
company
and
having
to
handle
the
inevitable
culture
clashes
and
process
mis-matches
.
